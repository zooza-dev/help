Individual Sessions: How to Sell, Plan, and Manage 1:1 Lessons in Zooza

This guide explains a practical workflow for 

individual (1:1) sessions

 in Zooza:

Collect interest / registrations

 for 1:1 sessions (even without fixed dates)

Create a 

private individual plan

 for each client (with sessions and payments)

Option A: Collect interest first (recommended)

Why this approach works

You can advertise “Individual sessions” without publishing a real schedule.

You still get 

registrations inside Zooza

 (client record + booking context).

Later, you convert each registration into a 

personal 1:1 plan

 (a private class/group with sessions).

Step 1: Create a programme for “Individual sessions”

Go to 

Programmes

Create a new programme, e.g. 

“Individual Sessions”

Set the programme type to 

Ongoing

Save

Tip:

 Keep the programme simple. The goal is to have a “container” to collect interest and later manage bookings.

Step 2: Create a group/class without dates (for interest collection)

Open the programme 

Individual Sessions

Create a new 

Group/Class

Do 

not

 add any sessions/timetable dates yet

Ensure it is visible for online registration 

only if you want to collect sign-ups publicly

Result: you can collect sign-ups even though there are no sessions yet.

You now have 

registrations in Zooza

, ready to be assigned to an individual plan.

Step 3: Collect registrations (interest)

Clients can register via your online booking flow (or you can add them 

manually

).

Once submitted, you will see these registrations in Zooza.

What happens next?

You now have a registration record linked to:

the client

the programme (“Individual Sessions”)

the initial group/class (interest placeholder)

From here, you can create the real 1:1 plan.

Step 4: Create a registration manually (optional)

You can also create registrations manually in Zooza, for example when:

a client calls / messages you directly

you want to register them without using the website

you want to copy an existing registration and tweak it

Where to do it (typical places)

Use whichever is most natural in your workflow:

A) From the Client profile

Open Zooza > Clients > 

Bookings

Use an action Create booking

B) Copy an existing registration

Open an existing registration

Use 

Copy booking

Adjust programme/group/payment plan

Optional: Share a private registration link for a specific individual class

Sometimes you want the class to stay 

non-public

, but still allow the parent to register online (instead of you creating the registration manually).

You can do this by sharing a 

private registration link

 to that specific class/group.

How it works

The class/group is 

not publicly listed

 on your website/widget.

Only people with the 

direct link

 can open the registration page and submit the registration.

Steps

Open the individual class/group (e.g. 

“1:1 – John Smith”

)

Find the option to copy the registration URL:

Copy URL 

or 

Customized link

 

Send this link to the parent.

Result: the parent can register the child into that specific individual plan via the link, while the class remains private.

Option B: Build the individual plan (private class per client)

This is the core model: 

one client = one private plan

 (one private class/group, sessions, and payment plan).

Step 5: Create a private 1:1 class/group for the client

In the programme 

Individual Sessions

, create a new 

Class

Name it something like:

“1:1 – John Smith”

or 

“John Smith (Individual Plan)”

Disable online registration (so it’s not publicly bookable) (during the process of class creation, or in the class settings).

Use this setting:

See guide: 

Online registration options

Goal:

 This class exists only for internal scheduling and client management.

Step 6: Add sessions (the actual 1:1 schedule)

Now add the real schedule for that client.

Example: every Tuesday at 10:00.

Guide: Creating Sessions in a Class

Tip:

 You can create sessions as:

recurring weekly sessions, or

individual dates when needed (more flexible for ad-hoc coaching)

Step 7: Make-up sessions (optional)

If you want to allow a client to cancel and pick another available time, enable custom replacements.

Guide: Custom make-up sessions

Typical use-case:

The instructor has a set of “available slots”

The client can reschedule into those slots (based on capacity/settings)

Step 8: Payment plan per individual booking

Each individual plan (booking) can have its own payment setup.

This is especially useful if:

client pays monthly

client pays per block (e.g. 10 sessions)

you want a tailored schedule (down payment, recurring invoices, etc.)

Guide: Payment templates on registration

Best practice:

 Keep a few reusable payment templates (e.g. “Monthly 1:1”, “10-pack”, “Pay-as-you-go”), and assign the right one per registration.

Recommended workflow summary

1) Create programme

 “Individual Sessions” (Ongoing)

2) Create interest group

 (no sessions)

3) Collect registrations

 (online or manual)

4) For each client:

Create a 

private 1:1 class/group

 named after the client

Add sessions (weekly or ad-hoc)

Enable replacement logic if needed

Assign the payment template for that registration

Notes & common pitfalls

Don’t publish the real 1:1 class online

 (unless you intentionally sell bookable slots).

Use a 

separate private class per client

 if you want clean reporting, payments, and scheduling.

If you want to offer “pick a time from available slots”, build availability via the 

replacement

 approach rather than publishing a fixed timetable.
