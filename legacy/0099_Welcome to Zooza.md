Abra Flexi Invoice Management System

Zooza allows you to connect directly with Abra Flexi, an invoicing and accounting system. By linking these two platforms, you can streamline your financial processes - invoices are generated automatically from Zooza and sent to Abra Flexi.

Important notes for the invoicing process and billing profiles

The invoice number series is defined in Abra Flexi.

VAT configurations

 are pulled from Zooza into Abra Flexi.

Invoices can only be edited or deleted in Abra Flexi.

Changes made in Abra Flexi are not synchronized back to Zooza.

The version of the invoice visible in Zooza remains unchanged after editing in Abra.

Currently, it is possible to connect only one database name (Company DB) per Zooza account.
