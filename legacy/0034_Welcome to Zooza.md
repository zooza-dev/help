Daily Business with Trials: Setup, Transfers, and Adjustments

Trials are a great way to introduce new clients to your classes — and Zooza gives you full flexibility to manage how they work. Below you’ll find the most common trial-related actions and how to handle them step by step.

Trial registrations cannot be created manually by admins or instructors and must be submitted by the client via the website booking form.

How can I make sure parents can’t choose their own trial start date — only the next available one?

You can control which trial dates appear on your website directly in the course settings.

 Go to:

 

Course > Settings > Trial > Sessions Shown in Form

Here you can decide whether to:

Show a fixed number of future sessions

, or

Show sessions within a specific date range

 (for example, always the next three weeks).

How to transfer a trial booking to another class

If you just need to move 

one session

, open the registration → 

Attendance

 → click 

Book a session

, then select the new date and class.

If you’re moving the 

entire trial registration

 to a different class:

Open the registration detail.

Go to the 

Class

 section and click 

Transfer

.

Select the new class (you can filter by course or location).

Click 

Transfer to another class

 → 

Continue

.

The registration status will remain 

Trial started

.

Choose the next session date.

Keep the payment unchanged if it’s already paid — tick 

Do not change payments

.

Decide whether to notify the client about the change (checkbox).

Confirm by clicking 

Continue

.

Go to 

Attendance

 to hide or add sessions as needed.

&amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;gt;

When transferring a trial, how do I hide old sessions and add new ones correctly?

You can manage attendance flexibly:

Click 

Hide

 to remove a session. This hides it from reports and from the client’s view. The client won’t get notifications for it.

Click 

Book a session

 to add a new one.

You’ll find both options in the 

Attendance

 section of the registration.

How to reschedule a single trial session

Go to the registration → 

Attendance

.

Click 

Hide

 to remove the original date.

Click 

Book a session

 to add the new date.

 The client and instructor will both receive a notification and see the updated session in their profile.

How to reserve a seat for the trial participant

If you want a trial participant to 

keep their seat reserved

 in the class until they either enrol or are marked as lost, go to:

 

Course > Settings > Trial > Reserve seat for trial attendee

 and check the box.

How to change the trial duration (e.g. more than one session)

To set a longer or paid trial, open:

 

Course > Settings > Trial

Under 

Trial type

, choose between:

Free trial (single or multiple sessions), or

Paid trial (single or multiple sessions).

You can also adjust the 

unit price per session

 here.

How to allow only trial bookings in classes

If you want clients to book 

only trials

 (and not full enrolments), open:

 

Course > Settings > Online Registration (Edit)

Under 

Registration Options Shown on Website

, select:

 

Trials only

 (or any other option that fits your setup).

Tip

Most trial settings are controlled at the course level — so each course can have its own unique setup, payment type, and visibility rules.

Trial Sessions and Group Overcapacity (Important Note)

In Zooza, group overcapacity can occur when 

Trial Sessions

 are used together with 

Blocks

 within the same Class.

For Trial Sessions, it is possible to configure the registration to 

reserve capacity for the full Class period

. This setup works reliably 

only in Class without Blocks

.

If a Class uses Blocks, the system cannot determine 

which Block

 the capacity should be reserved for when a Trial Session is configured to reserve a seat. In this case, Trial Sessions reserve capacity 

only for individual dates

, not for the full Class period. As a result, subsequent full-period registrations may exceed the Class's total capacity.

How to avoid overcapacity

At the moment, the 

only reliable way

 to prevent overcapacity in Class with Blocks is to configure Trial Sessions to use 

Extra Capacity

.

If Extra Capacity is not used, Class capacity must be 

actively monitored

, and Trial Sessions should be 

managed manually

.

What if a trial client doesn’t show up?

If a parent booked a trial but didn’t attend, the outcome depends on your trial settings.




If your trials are configured to 

hold a spot in the class

, the trial may still be “active” and can 

continue to count towards capacity

 until the trial process ends.







If you don’t plan to continue with that parent, the recommended action is to 

mark the booking as 

Trial Lost

.




How to mark a trial as “Trial Lost”




Open the 

booking detail

.







Change the 

status

 to 

Trial Lost

.







If you send the optional email, the parent will receive a message with a link to book again (they’ll be taken to the booking form).







This stops the trial flow and 

releases the spot

 in the class.
