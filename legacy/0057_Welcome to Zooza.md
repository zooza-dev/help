Auto-enrollment

Auto-enrollment is used for efficient course enrollment for existing clients with a pre-filled registration form. This allows the client to receive priority enrollment in a new period (for group courses) or to select a new date for individual sessions, so that you can arrange further continuation via Zooza.

Priority enrollment 

for existing clients, whom you want to offer courses before displaying them on your website. 

In this case, we recommend disabling online registration for these courses (in the course settings, 

Online Registration

) or performing a bulk edit also in the

 Online Registration

 tile and disabling 

Online Registration 

only for the new classes you wish to offer priority enrollment to.

In the case of 

individual courses,

 this feature lets you arrange the start of the next class with the client without manually preparing the class beforehand, exactly according to their preferences.

To successfully use auto-enrollment, you need to have created an offer of courses and classes before activating the settings.

Auto-enrollment is configured in 2 places:

At the course level in tile 

Auto-enrollment

At the class level in the 

Settings

 tile

1. At the course level

First, you need to set which courses and classes you want to offer clients for enrollment in the new period.

Open the settings of the selected course.

In 

Auto-enrollment

 tile click on 

Edit

Select the type of offer:

Suggest classes 

- for group classes and follow-up courses

Duplicate current class

 - ideal for individual clients.

Enter how many days before the end of the current term the system should notify clients.

Note:

 If you have manually set the class end date to a different day, the system will use this manual date instead of the last scheduled date.

Suggest classes

If you have group ccourses and would like to offer existing clients the option to enroll before opening registration to new clients, select the 

Suggest Classes

 type of auto

-

enrollment

Define the offer:

Billing period

Filter specific courses (All courses, Only the billing period the client enrolled for, Selected courses only)

Age restriction - e.g. offer only for children within a selected age range at the time of registration – enter months or years

Attention! 

Only courses with an age restriction filled in under 

Extra Fields

 will be included in the offer.

Distance (set the maximum distance in km from the location where the client is currently enrolled)

      2.  Finally, select classes you want to include in the auto-enrollment.

            

Duplicate current class

This option allows the client to choose when they want to start the next class – especially suitable for individual sessions. Details on how this option works on client's side can be found in the 

Client View 

section of this manual.

At the class level

If the auto-enrollment functionality is active and you need to add another class to the course (or simply want to expand the list of classes for auto-enrollment), open the 

Settings 

tile. There you will find a checkbox to add the selected class to the auto-enrollment offer.

Note:

 If the course does not have auto-enrollment enabled, the application will notify you and even if the checkbox is selected, this setting will be ignored.
