Lecturers working hours

In the 

Lecturers 

section, lecturers can manage their working time. If they define their working hours and possible absences, this data will then be taken into account by the system when scheduling terms.

Example: 

Alice works Tuesdays to Fridays from 9:00 to 16:00 with an hour lunch break.

1. Setting working hours

In the application, she clicks on the 

Add Availability

 button

As the type selects 

Working Hours

Selects a date range. In our example we choose 4th. January to 7th. January.

As the time range selects 9:00 to 16:00

She activates repetition at a weekly frequency. Depending on how long such working hours will be valid, the number of repetitions will be chosen.

On the calendar in the app, availability will be displayed as follows:

Step 2 - Lunch break

Since Alice goes out for lunch in the middle of the day, she needs to tell the system that she doesn't work then.

Again clicks the 

Add Availability

 button

This time she selects the 

Absence

 option and enters the same data as before, except that the time period will be from 11:30 to 12:30

She chooses the name of this absence: lunch break.

The resulting calendar will look like this:

How availability works when creating terms

From now on, when scheduling terms, the app will inform the admin that Alice is unavailable for appointments at lunchtime.

Mass deleting of availability/absences

Since the availability of tutors can change frequently in the application, you have the option of mass deletion. This allows you to edit faster.

In the lecturer's details under 

Working hours

, click 

Activate

.

Select the availability/absences you want to delete by clicking on them and click on the 

Delete selected availability

 button.

Note

: You can only do a mass deletion within one month. If you move to the next month, your previous withdrawal will be cancelled
