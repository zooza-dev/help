Payment options

Cash payment

The most common and worst option is to pay in cash. Why the worst? You have to work with banknotes and everything has to be done manually. When a customer hands you money you have the following options:

Manually enter the payment on the registration detail

Mark the registration as paid in cash

Bank transfer

A very popular payment method today is the classic bank transfer. This is where the app can already be of some help and assistance. The money you receive into your bank account can be processed in our system using two methods:

Manual matching of payments via exports from the bank

Automatic payment matching based on bank payment notifications

You set up a payment via wire transfer as a cash payment with the payment details sent to your clients.

Online card payment

A convenient form of payment is card payment. In this case, the payment is recorded immediately and you don’t have to do anything. The application automatically marks the registration as paid and also notifies the customer that the payment has been made. Customers can pay with all common payment cards. This service is charged at 3.5% as a third party service. It is included in the price that the payment gateway does not need to be handled in any way. You have it automatically integrated directly in the system.

You have 2 options to choose from:

CardPay

Stripe

Stripe

When choosing Stripe, clients will be able to save their card after payment, making it easier for them to pay in the future. This means that when a client wants to pay for another course or service/product, the payment gateway will offer them the card that was saved the first time they used it. If the client does not set the card to be saved differently the first time they make a payment, for security reasons, they will also need to authorize the payment using the 3D Secure protocol for subsequent payments.

Note

: Information on how and if a payment was made via Stripe is visible on the registration details in the Payments section. If the payment does not go through, the system will try again a total of 3 times – these attempts will show up in the Transaction Statement/Online Payments table on registration.

Online payment by bank transfer

Similar to card payments, online transfer is a popular and especially convenient form of payment. The difference is that the customer does not enter card details, but logs into their internet banking and approves the pre-populated payment order there. Here again, the application automatically marks the registration as paid and notifies the customer. As a third-party service, this service is also subject to a fee. And since it’s a service for you, you don’t have to handle anything. Online payment by bank transfer is available in Zooza and you can use it right away.
