WhatsApp Integration & Usage (Beta)

Status:

 This feature is in 

beta

 and improving continuously.

Availability:

 If you don’t see 

Connect to WhatsApp

 in Zooza, either (a) your plan doesn’t include the integration or (b) WhatsApp Business Platform isn’t enabled for your account. In both cases, 

contact us

 and we’ll help.

What you’ll need

A 

Facebook (Meta) Business Account

 with admin rights.

A 

phone number

 to dedicate to WhatsApp 

Business Platform

 (API).

Note: A number connected to the API 

cannot

 be used in the standard WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business mobile app at the same time. Many brands keep two numbers: one for 

Zooza automation & threads

, one for 

manual mobile chats

.

Connect WhatsApp to Zooza (step-by-step)




Open WhatsApp settings in Zooza


In the app, go to 

Communication → WhatsApp

.







Click “Connect to WhatsApp”


This starts Meta’s guided connection flow in a new window.

3. Complete Meta’s connection flow




Make sure you are logged into Facebook as a 

Business Admin

 who can manage the Business Account. Then follow the prompts:




Continue as 

you

 → 

Connect as 

you







Select Busine

ss

: choose the correct 

Business Account

 and (if asked) the Page/portfolio you’ll use.




Business details

: choose the 

business name

 and 

country

 for the franchise/company.




WhatsApp profile

: set the 

display name

 (or select an existing WhatsApp profile/number).




If using an 

existing number

, it must be 

disconnected

 from all other apps (including the WhatsApp Business mobile app). One number ↔ one platform.







Choose category

 (e.g., 

Education

).







Add new phone number

 (if needed) and complete 

verification

 (SMS/voice code).







Confirm

 and wait—connection can take a few minutes. 

Do not close

 the window.

4. Return to Zooza

Go back to the 

Communication → WhatsApp

 screen and 

refresh

. You should see 

Status: Done

.

5. Create your PIN

Set a 

6-digit PIN

 and 

save it

. Meta may request this PIN later for security actions in Business Manager.

6. Verify status


Confirm that Zooza shows your connected number and status as active.

Verify your Business with Meta

Business verification unlocks 

more templates

 and 

higher free message volumes

.


Do this in Facebook Business Manager:

https://business.facebook.com/latest/settings/business_info

Add payment method and Meta pricing requirements




To send outbound system messages (templates) from Zooza, Meta requires a valid payment method added to your WhatsApp Business Account. Receiving incoming messages and replying within the 24-hour service window is free, but any proactive or system-triggered outbound message (e.g., reminders, confirmations, changes) is billed by Meta according to its conversation pricing.

What this means for your setup:


• You must add a credit card in Meta Business Manager under WhatsApp → Billing.


• Without a payment method, Zooza cannot deliver system messages, even if templates are approved.


• Incoming messages: free. You can reply to any parent message within the 24-hour window at no charge.


• Outbound system messages: billed by Meta based on conversation type and region.


• Full pricing overview:

Once your card is added and Meta billing is active, Zooza can automatically send templates for login, confirmations, reminders, schedule changes, and other system events.

How WhatsApp works in Zooza

1) Conversations




From now on, when a parent messages your connected number, the conversation appears in 

Zooza App → Messages → WhatsApp → Conversations

.







A parent message opens a 

24-hour window

 where your team can reply freely from within Zooza.







Each reply from either side 

extends

 the window by another 24 hours.




2) Templates




After business verification, Zooza submits a set of 

official WhatsApp templates

 (e.g., login, confirmations, reminders, changes, payments) for 

Meta approval

.







Once approved, Zooza will 

automatically

 use them for system events.







You can edit wording and languages; newly edited templates must be 

re-approved

.







Manage in 

Zooza App → Messages → WhatsApp → Templates

.




3) Broadcasts / Mass messaging 

(in development)




Sending approved templates to a larger audience (e.g., term announcements) is possible but 

under construction

 in the UI.







Treat broadcasts as 

marketing

; follow Meta rules and local regulations.




Compliance & Best-Practice Tips




Use helpful, expected messages.

 Time-sensitive updates (reminders, changes, login codes) work best on WhatsApp. Longer documents and policy info are often better via 

email

. Zooza can 

send both

.







Respect the 24-hour window.

 Outside the window, you must use an 

approved template

 to re-engage.







Don’t spam.

 Keep broadcasts relevant and spaced. Consider opt-in where required by local law.




Choose your number strategy.




API number (Zooza) = automation, logging, permissions, audit trail.







Optional second number = ad-hoc mobile chats (if your ops require it).







Brand & privacy.

 Messages link back to your 

website/Parent Portal

. Zooza keeps a log for auditing and GDPR purposes.







Pricing & limits.

 Zooza charges for the 

integration feature

, not per message. Meta grants 

free volumes

 up to certain tiers; higher tiers follow Meta policy.




Troubleshooting




“Connect to WhatsApp” button missing


Your plan may not include WhatsApp, or it isn’t enabled on your account. 

Contact us

 to enable.







“Not an admin” or can’t select Business


Ask your Facebook org owner to grant you 

Business Admin

 rights for the correct Business Account.







Number already in use


Disconnect the number from all other platforms (including the 

WhatsApp Business mobile app

) before connecting to the API.







Template approval delays


Meta review can take time. Keep copy clear and compliant. You can switch language variants after approval.







No messages arriving


Verify: connection status in Zooza, Business verification, template approval, and that you’re messaging from/to the 

connected number

.




FAQ

Do parents need to install an app?


No. They receive WhatsApp messages and follow links to your 

website/Parent Portal

.

Can we choose which events send on WhatsApp?


Core touchpoints are 

pre-wired

 and also send email. You can edit template 

content/language

; triggers are fixed for consistency.

Can we keep using our mobile WhatsApp Business app on the same number?


No. An API-connected number 

cannot

 be used in the mobile app. Many brands use two numbers (automation vs. ad-hoc mobile).

How do we increase message limits?


Complete 

Business Verification

 in Facebook Business Manager to unlock higher tiers.
