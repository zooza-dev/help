How to change an instructor in a class or session

In Zooza, you can change an instructor either at the 

class level

 or directly on 

sessions

, depending on what you need.

Changing an instructor at the class level




Open the 

Class (Timetable)

 you want to update.







Find the 

Instructor

 setting. 







Select a different instructor.




Choose whether the change should apply to:




All sessions

, or







Only upcoming sessions

.




This sets the main (responsible) instructor for the class. Past sessions are not affected.

Changing an instructor for specific sessions

If you need to change the instructor only for selected sessions:




Go to 

Sessions

.







Use filters (for example by date, class, or location). 







Select one or more sessions.







Use 

Bulk actions

Change instructor

This is useful when covering a specific day, substitution, or temporary change.

What updates automatically

the instructor’s 

calendar

reports

,







and 

session reminders and notifications
