Payment templates creation

Within the payment templates, you have several options on how to use them for your courses and clients. Please refer to 

the instructions for

 more information.

Usage

For a practical application of the different payment types, here are some examples.

Language courses

I am an organizer of language courses that last the whole school year, i.e. from September to June of the following year. I want to allow clients to pay for the course monthly, semi-annually, or in one lump sum for the entire year, as it suits them according to their means. I want to provide an incentive discount for paying in advance for the entire course. For such a course I will set up the following templates:

Periodic payment in advance with no discount – monthly. 

It will be used for regular monthly payments for the course, which will go out to the client on the day of the month that you can choose.

Periodic payment in advance with a smaller discount – semi-annually. 

It will be used to pay for the course in two installments. If the client chooses this payment, he will have a discount of, for example, 5% on the course, which will be automatically calculated from the price of the course.

One-time payment in advance with a larger discount.

 It will be used to pay for the course for its entire duration, i.e. the whole year. If the client chooses this payment, he will have a discount of, for example, 10% on the course, which will be automatically calculated from the price of the course.

Children courses

I am an organizer of exercises for children, which have a duration of one semester. I want to allow parents to pay for the course in 3 instalments or in one lump sum for the whole duration of the course, as it suits whom. I want to provide an incentive discount for paying in advance for the entire course. I also want them to have the option of a discount if they have and register more children. For such a course I will set up the following templates:

One-time payment with discount. 

It will be used to pay for the entire duration of the course if the parent registers only one child. I will set a smaller incentive discount, for example 3%.

One-time payment Siblings with a discount of, for example, 20%.

 It will be used to pay for the entire duration of the course, in case a parent registers more than one child. The discount is automatically calculated from the price for 2x course price You need to set up the option to add a person at the course level – online registration.

Periodic payment for a fixed number of installments without discount. 

It will be used for payment divided into 3 equal parts, in case the parent registers only one child. Here I have no reason to give a discount.

Periodic payment for a fixed number of installments, Siblings with a discount of, for example, 10%. 

It will be used for payment divided into 3 equal parts, in case a parent registers more than one of his/her children. The discount is automatically calculated from the price for 2x course price and divided into 3 parts. You need to set up the option to add a person at the course level – online registration.

Set up payment templates

In order to set up payments on a course, you need to create payment templates first. To set them up, proceed as follows:

Click on the Settings tab in the left menu and then click on the Payments

To add a new payment template, click the Add button at the top of the screen and fill in the required parameters for the template

Select one of the options as required:

One-time payment – you have the option to set up a one-time payment for the course.

For example, if a client chooses a course that lasts half a year, but 
does not want to pay monthly, they choose to pay for the entire course 
at once.

For such a payment you can give a discount either none, in EUR or as a percentage.

Periodic pre-paid payment

 – you have the option to set whether the course can be paid gradually, i.e. in frequency.

Here you select from the options – Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-annually, 
Annually, After N terms (the number of terms after which the next 
installment for the course will be issued), Fixed number of installments
 (the number of installments into which the price for the course will be
 divided).

The course provider has the option to grant a discount for this type of payment either none, in EUR or as a percentage.

Periodic payment paid in arrears according to attendance

This option allows you to charge clients based on their actual attendance. The system creates and sends instalments only after the client has attended the required number of sessions, depending on the frequency you set.

There are two possible modes:

1) Periodic frequency (e.g., monthly)

When using a time-based frequency:

When attendance is recorded, the system creates an instalment scheduled for the next anniversary date of the frequency (e.g., next month).

Each time attendance is marked as 

“attended”

, the amount on that instalment increases.

When the instalment’s scheduled date arrives, it is processed during the nightly job and the client receives the payment request. At this moment, the registration receives the corresponding outstanding balance.

If the client does not attend any session within the chosen frequency period (e.g., no attendance in a whole month), 

no instalment is generated

.

2) After N sessions (e.g., payment after every 2 sessions)

A When using a frequency based on a number of attended sessions:

When attendance is recorded, the system creates an instalment scheduled one year ahead.

(This is only a placeholder date — it will be adjusted once the required number of attendances is reached.)

Each time an attendance is marked as 

“attended”

, the amount on that instalment increases.

When the required number of attended sessions (N) is reached, the instalment is rescheduled to “today” and will be processed during the nightly job. At this moment, the registration receives the outstanding balance.

If the required number of attendances is reached multiple times on the same day

(example: frequency = every 2 sessions, and 4 sessions are recorded in one day),

then 

multiple instalments will be created on that same day

.

Save the template by clicking the 

Save button.

Note:

 If you use discounted payment templates, you can find a clear list of them in the Payments - Discounts section.

Other template settings, template activation in courses

In the payment settings, you can edit individual templates, set their 
visibility to customers/tutors or delete a template. You can also 
quickly and easily activate the template on the courses of your choice.

To change and modify the template or activate it on the course, please follow these steps:

V zozname platobných šablón kliknite na ikonu pera vedľa šablóny, ktorú chcete upravovať

In template editing you have the option to set the visibility of the template, i.e. what group of people will be able to use this template – Customers, Lecturers or both.

1. Customers – you choose the option to have the template visible to customers directly when they register on your site. 

2. Lecturers – visibility for lecturers means that the lecturer will also be able to assign registrations to a given template

Below in the courses section you have a list of your courses and for each of them you can activate or deactivate the template

When you make changes to the template, we recommend that you 

Sync Settings.

 This will ensure that any changes made to the template will also be 
reflected in courses and groups where it has already been activated.

Note:

 If you have changed template settings, these 
will not automatically be transferred to the courses where the template 
is applied. If you want all courses to have their installment calendars 
set according to this version of the template, synchronize their 
settings. The system also keeps alerting you

Then 

Save

 the changes. Alternatively, you also have the option of using the 

Delete

 template

These payment templates created can then be used and inserted into your new or existing courses/groups.

Insert payment templates into a course/group

The created payment templates need to be inserted into newly created or 
already existing courses. The templates created in this way can be 
combined in the courses according to your wishes and needs. This means 
that you can use multiple payment templates for one course.
