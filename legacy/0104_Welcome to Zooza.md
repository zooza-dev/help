How to sell products during registration / booking (T-shirt example)

Overview

In Zooza, selling a physical product during the registration (booking) flow is a two-step setup:

Create Services (items / variants)

 – e.g., T-shirt sizes (S, M, L) with price and stock

Create a Product

 – group those services into one product called “T-shirt” and decide if it’s optional/mandatory

 Then you 

attach the product to a class / timetable

, so it appears during booking and/or in the client profile.

<br>

Step 1: Create Services first (variants like sizes)

Go to 

Services

Click 

Create new service

Create one service per variant (example):

“T-shirt size S”

“T-shirt size M”

“T-shirt size L”

For each service:

Set the 

unit price

Set 

max quantity per order

 (how many can be bought per booking)

If stock is limited, set 

stock quantity

Save

 each service

Why this step exists: Services work as the “items” (variants) inside a product.

Step 2: Create the Product (the final thing you sell)

Go to 

Products

Click 

Create product

Fill in:

Name

 (example: “T-shirt”)

Enable 

Available for online checkout

 (important if you sell online as a stand alone ITEM - not only during booking proces)

Decide what the product is used for:

You can sell 

physical products

 (T-shirts, materials)

Or 

digital products

 (videos, ebooks, bundles) the same way (product + items)

or combination

Step 3: Add items (services) into the product

Open your product (example: “T-shirt”)

In 

Items

, click 

Add item

Add the services you created (S / M / L)

Mandatory vs Optional

Mandatory item selection (recommended for sizes):

Enable 

Mandatory

This forces the client to choose a size during booking (so the product shows correctly on the website and can’t be “half-selected”)

Optional product:

If you do not make it mandatory, clients can skip buying the product during booking

Save the product.

Step 4: Attach the product to a class / timetable (sell during booking)

Go to 

Timetable / Class

Open the class settings and find 

Product settings 

Select which products you want to sell during booking

Choose 

“T-shirt”

Optional (recommended):

Enable 

Available in client profile

This allows the product to be visible and purchasable from the parent / student profile after booking

Save

Step 5: Test the booking flow

Open the booking / registration page as a client

Select a child (or a participant)

You will see the product (e.g., “T-shirt”) in the booking flow

When a size is selected, the 

total price increases

 accordingly

Example: Registration = £100

Registration + T-shirt = £100 + T-shirt price

Notes & tips

Use 

one service product with variants

 to keep it clean and easy to report.

Use 

max quantity per order

 if you want to limit “how many per booking”.

Using services always use 

stock number

You can sell 

videos/ebooks/bundles

 the same way—create product and attach to booking. (Delivery is handled by your digital delivery process outside this specific setup.)

What Zooza does (and what it doesn’t)

Zooza supports the 

operational layer

 of selling products around your bookings. It helps you:

show products during 

registration / booking

 (or in the client profile as an upsell)

record what was purchased (product + variant like size)

track 

stock

 (if you use stock numbers)

include the product in the 

booking price

 and record payment-related information

keep everything visible for admins in booking and client records, including basic reporting context

Important: Zooza is not full e-commerce fulfillment

Zooza does 

not

 handle the full e-commerce chain such as:

shipping / delivery logistics

packing / fulfillment workflows

courier integrations

returns and exchanges handling

That part (fulfillment and shipping) must be handled by the business owner using their own process/tools.

Practical takeaway

Zooza is not a 100% e-commerce platform, but for 

smaller volumes

 and simple add-on sales (T-shirts, materials, simple digital add-ons), it is usually more than enough.
