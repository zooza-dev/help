Edit automatic notifications of an upcoming event

The automatic notification

 is one of the messages that you can customize yourself in the message templates. So you can customise the message text to suit your organisation’s needs:

Change the way of reaching out

Change the terminology (sign out for the lesson/exercise/event)

Add written information on the latest time to cancel the lesson

Setting up the template

Message templates can be found under 

Communications – Message templates

When you open the window, you will see a longer list of different templates. This particular template can be found a little further down in the 

Notifications 

section.

The prepared text in the template is for your inspiration and needs to be checked. It shall contain written information on the latest date by which the client can log out from the event. However, this is only textual information and is not linked to the unsubscribe rules you have set up in Zooza. You can set the latest possible time to log out or check your settings in 

Settings

, 

General settings.

Time to send a reminder

You can set the time when such an email is sent to the client yourself AND directly in the template, under the template name, above the subject and the text of the email. The time between 0-24 can be determined by you. The reminder is sent the day before the term. 

Tip: 

Set the reminder to send so that the client has enough time to cancel, according to your rules. For example, you have set the log out time in Zooza to a fixed hour – until 22:00 the day before the event, and thus sending a reminder of the term with the option to log out directly in the email you set for example at 18:00 to create at least a 4-hour window when the client can log out.
