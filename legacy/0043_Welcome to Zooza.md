Viewing/tracking billable events

If you already have set up billable events, the application will start calculating the progression of the group differently:

 You can switch between the types of statistics in the group list. Next to the 

Sort

 drop-down menu there is a filter button to set the View Settings. You can switch between viewing the 

schedule registrations

 or the 

schedule progress

.

This selection is then saved and retained in all user sessions.

View schedule progress

If the group does not have set billable events, then the view of 
schedule progress for groups shows the total number of available dates 
(scheduled, unscheduled) compared to the number of events that have 
already happened.

If the group already has billable events set, the view shows the 
total number of billable events available compared to the number of 
billable events that have already happened. Next to the coin pile icon 
there is number in brackets indicating the number of billable events 
subject to payment that are set on the group or on the course.

Attention!

 The setting on the group/course specifies how many billable events the 
group SHOULD HAVE. When viewing with billable events, we are looking at 
ACTUAL STATUS of events that are marked as paid. The number in 
parentheses serves as confirmation that the group does not actually 
contain MORE or LESS billable events than it should.

Viewing over/under drawn billable events

As mentioned earlier, the number of events actually paid may differ 
from the settings in the group/course. Zooza will notify you of this 
status as follows:

In group list

 when the group overrun is displayed: 2/4 (10)

This 
means that the group has already set 2 billable events out of 4, but the
 total should be set to 10 events.

In group detail

 

under billable events setting, a warning will 
appear to remind you that you have more or less billable events than you
 should have

In event detail

under billable events setting, a warning will 
appear to remind you that you have more or less billable events than you
 should have.

You can view the overdrawn/under drawn billable events using the filter at the group level.

View billable events in calendar

On the calendar tile 

there is a “EURO coins” icon, which indicates whether the date is paid or not.

On the date detail

 of the calendar, a coin pile icon is also displayed in the 

Status

 section to indicate that the date is paid.

View in the Lecturer report

In order to view a billable event in the lecturer report, see the 

Paid

 column, which indicates that the term is paid.

View in the Client profile

In the client profile on the course report, the field: Total Events 
is displayed, which shows either the total number of billable events set
 for this group, or the total number of events in the group (if no 
billable events are set).
