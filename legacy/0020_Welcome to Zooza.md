Regional holidays

Holidays are different for each state, city and region. That’s why we
 went to a detailed solution where you can set a region for each 
location you run your courses in. 




Based on this setting, the holidays of the specific region will be 
automatically added to your app. You will see the specific dates of the 
holidays at the level of inserting events into the group, where you will 
be reminded that the dates are during the holidays. You can choose to:




keep these terms, if you are running your courses also during the holidays

delete these terms manually by clicking on the 

Bin icon

skip these terms automatically by clicking on the 

Skip Holidays

 and 

Skip School breaks

 checkboxes
