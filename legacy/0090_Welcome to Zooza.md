Discount code

A discount code is one of the types of client discounts you will find 
within the app. Typical use is within campaigns or collaborations, where
 you generate a code with a certain name and setting and those clients 
who know it can use it.

Note: 

The discount can only be applied to courses by 
entering the code in the registration form. In order for clients to be 
able to enter the code, you must enable the 

Discount
