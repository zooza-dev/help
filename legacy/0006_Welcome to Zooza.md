Automatic notification of an upcoming event

This is the email that always arrives to the client the day before lesson/event. If a client is enrolled in a group that has lessons every 
Tuesday, they will always receive a reminder on Monday that there is a lesson/event tomorrow. 




The reminder is helpful to your clients for a number of reasons:




In case they have a mind like a sieve. In the rush of responsibilities, sometimes you forget what day it is.

Inform them of the time and place. For example, if it’s a reminder 
of an event for a replacement lesson, it takes place on a different 
day and at a different time than they are used to. And maybe in another 
place.

Reminders can go to an additional email and therefore, for example, 
also remind the other parent that the child has an event/lesson 
tomorrow. This can be helpful if the parents have alternating care and 
one parent brings the child to exercise one week and the other parent 
the next week. The additional email can be added by the client himself 
in his profile, or you can do it for him at the level of his 
registration.

and most importantly – 

a
 reminder of an upcoming term allows the client to log out of the lesson
 with one click.If they are home sick, it is very easy to forget to go 
to their profile and log out of the lesson there

.

 An 
automatic reminder with an opt-out option is just the thing to make sure
 they don’t forget to opt out, creating a spot in the group for someone 
who wants to use up a replacement lesson.

Turning off email notifications about an upcoming event




If you wish to disable sending these notifications for some courses, 
this can be done at the course level. To turn off notifications for a 
specific course, do the following:




Find the course for which you want to turn off notifications and open it

In the 

Online Registration

 section, click 

Change

Scroll down and click on the blue pipe at the bottom right of the 

Communication

 section so that it disappears. Each course is preconfigured so that automatic notifications are sent.

Confirm the settings by clicking 

Save










Setting up different notification emails for different courses?




Do you have a need to send a different notification email to clients 
who are attending an adult course and a different email wording for 
clients who are enrolled in a children’s course with you? Or do you need
 a different text for the online course?




In Zooza, you can create multiple templates and associate either a 
standard notification email or a template you create with each course. 




To be able to associate a different notification email with a course, you need to create one first:




under 

Communication,

 select 

Message templates

This will open a list of templates. Scroll down to 

Notifications

Under 

Automatic event reminder

 there is a standard template but also the option 

Add new template 







Click on this option and name your template the way you need. For example, 

automatic term reminders – for online courses

 or a name that suits you

Fill in the subject and body text for this notification




Adding a new custom template to a course




Now that you have a new custom template created, you can assign it to a specific course:




click on the desired course

open the 

Online Registration

 section by clicking on the 

Change

 box

Scroll down and select your desired template at the bottom right of the 

Communication

 section

Don’t forget to 

Save
