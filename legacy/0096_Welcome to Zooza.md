Labels/drawers for selected payments

The payment drawers act as a colour-coded marker for individual payments. They are mainly used for the selection and subsequent display of specific payments.

In the 

Payments Received 

section, simply click on the colour of the payment.

You can select the same colour-coded payments by setting the filter also in the 

Payments Received

 section and clicking on the 

Search 

button.
