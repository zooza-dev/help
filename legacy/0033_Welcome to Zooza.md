Types of registrations

Registration options

Normal registration

If the group has not yet started, each registration will proceed in 
standard mode. Thus, after registration, the client’s payment is 
expected and the client is automatically subscribed to the group of his 
choice.

Waiting list

If the capacity of the group is full, the registrations will be 
switched to the waiting list mode. Such customers receive a different 
notification email and are not expected to pay for the course. On the 
contrary, customers expect you to reach out to them and offer them a 
different group, or directly create a new group and move them into it.

Late registration

Once a group starts, regardless of whether it is full or not, all 
registrations are automatically classified as late. Similar to a waiting
 list, you will be expected to communicate with the customer and 
negotiate payment terms and their joining an already established group 
or other suitable solution.

Trial

The Trial Lesson status is visible on the registration only during the period when the client is logged in for a trial lesson. Detailed information on setting up trial lessons at the course level can be found

.

Registration status

Each registration contains an icon that shows what type it is.

Attention! The registration creation status is always the last record, previous records/changes are overwritten.

Manually

The registration was created manually by the administrator directly in the application.

By Client

The registration was created by the client himself via the registration form on the organizer's website.

Copied

The application administrator used the copy registration function and thus the client registration was copied to the next course.

Moved

The application used the move registration function and thus the client's registration was moved to another course/group.

Payment

Each registration, in addition to its main status (Registered, Waitlisted, Late Registration), also has a billing status.

Unpaid

Typically this is a new registration that has not yet been paid. 
Payment status does not affect whether or not a customer can attend a 
course. It’s purely up to you and your setup whether you want to have 
the money upfront before the course starts, or if you’re also 
comfortable collecting money from customers on an ongoing basis.

Partially reimbursed

Registration whose debt has not been settled in full. Typically, this
 may be the case where you and the client have agreed on two or three 
instalments of the full amount of the course.

Paid

The best condition. The customer paid everything.

Overpaid

This also happens. If the customer sends more money than needed, the 
system will automatically highlight this and notify the customer as 
well.
