Dashboard 2.0 in the Parent Profile (Parent Portal)

For parents: This is your family dashboard. It helps you manage registrations, sessions, make-ups, passes, credits, discounts, and payments in one place.

 For providers (admins): This dashboard reduces support requests and makes the parent journey clearer, especially around payments and “special cases”.

What is Dashboard 2.0?

Dashboard 2.0 is the latest version of the Parent Profile (Parent Portal). It is embedded on your provider’s website and usually matches the provider’s branding (colors and style).

It is designed to answer the most common parent questions:

“What am I enrolled in?”

“What’s next?”

“Do I need to pay something?”

“Do I have a make-up?”

“Do I have credits / passes / discounts?”

“Where can I find my invoices?”

How to use it (parent guide)

1) Switch between family members

At the top, you can see family members (for example your children).

 Click a name or avatar to focus on one person.

Important:

Some sections are family-level and won’t change when you switch a child (for example some orders or discounts, depending on how your provider uses them).

Sections like bookings and sessions are usually tied to a specific child.

2) Payments (what to pay, what is paid)

In Payments, you can see:

Unpaid items (if any)

Paid items

Payment details (amount, status)

If something is unpaid:

Open the unpaid item

Continue to payment gateway (if online payment is enabled) or to payment instructions

After payment, the status updates automatically

Why this is useful: you do not need to ask the provider “Did you receive my payment?” or “What do I still owe?”

3) Upcoming sessions (and livestream link if used)

In Upcoming sessions, you can quickly see what is next.

 If your provider uses online sessions, a livestream link can appear here.

Tip: If you cannot attend, check the cancellation or make-up rules in your provider’s policy (each provider is different).

4) Bookings (your active and open registrations)

In Bookings, you can see:

Active bookings (currently enrolled)

Open bookings

You can use this section to understand:

Who is registered

Which product/programme it is

What the current status is

5) Benefits (your extras, with history)

The dashboard groups “benefits” in one place, typically:

Make-ups

Discounts

Vouchers / passes

Credits

A key part is history:

You can see what you already used

You can see what is still available

This helps avoid confusion like:

“I thought I still had a make-up left”

“I had credits, where did they go?”

Detailed sections (what each one means)

Make-ups (including history)

If your provider allows make-up sessions, you may see:

Available make-ups

Used make-ups (history)

Typical parent actions:

Check if you have a make-up available

See where it was used in the past

Choose a replacement session (depending on provider setup)

Discounts (including history)

If your provider uses discounts, you may see:

Available discounts

Used or expired discounts (history)

Tip: Discounts can be family-level (not always tied to one child).

Vouchers / passes (entry passes)

This is typically used for:

Entry passes

Punch cards

Permanent passes

You may see:

Available vouchers/passes

Unavailable/expired ones

History (if enabled)

Credits (including usage details)

Credits are usually shown in groups to make them easier to understand:

Recently used credits

Other credits

When available, you can also see:

Where the credit was used

When it was used

Orders (summary + details)

At the end, you can see an orders summary:

How many are unpaid

How many are paid

You can open the section to see details for each order.

Quick navigation menu (bottom menu)

At the bottom, there is a quick menu that lets you jump to a section instantly (for example: Bookings, Benefits, Orders).

 This is useful when you do not want to scroll.

Notes about filtering (why some sections do not change per child)

When you switch between children, some sections may not filter. This is normal when the data is tied to the parent account or the whole family (not one child).

If something looks “the same” after switching children, it usually means:

It is shared across the family, or

It comes from an order/payment that is not linked to one child

For providers (admins): Why this dashboard helps you

This dashboard typically reduces support and admin workload because:

Parents can see payment status themselves

Parents can find invoices (if enabled)

Parents understand what benefits they have (make-ups, credits, passes)

Parents can self-serve common questions instead of contacting your team

Alert: Dashboard 2.0 (Beta)

Dashboard 2.0 is available as a Beta for some providers. Most standard parent journeys work as expected, but a few uncommon edge cases may still be refined (for example, complex family setups or specific benefit/filter combinations). If anything looks inconsistent, please contact your provider’s support and include a short description of what you clicked and what you expected (a screenshot helps).

FAQ

Where do I pay an unpaid item?

 Go to Payments, open the unpaid item, and continue to payment gateway (if enabled).

Where do I find make-ups or replacement sessions?

 Check the Make-ups section under Benefits.

Why do I not see something for one child only?

 Some items are shared across the family (parent-level), so they cannot be filtered per child.

Can I download invoices?

 If your provider enables invoices, you will see them in the portal (usually near payments/orders).
