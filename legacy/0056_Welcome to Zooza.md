Online registration

To control how the course is displayed on your website and how communication with clients is managed, use this setting. It includes three parts:

Online registration

Customizing the registration form

Communication

Online registration

Registration options

In the

 Registration options

 section you set the visibility on your website and in the registration form.you can control what is visible on your website and in the registration form. If your course includes a 

Trial 

or 

Blocks

, you can decide exactly what you want clients to see.

Example:

 If you don’t want clients to choose between blocks and the full course, select the 

Blocks only

 option.

Multiple registrations for the course

When you enable multiple registrations for a course, you can choose whose information you need to collect — only from the main registrant or from every participant.

We also recommend selecting the 

Payments are managed by registrant 

option in the 

Price and Payment 

tile. This ensures that all payments for the registrations are grouped under the main registration, using a single variable symbol, and allows clients to pay everything in one transaction.

Other

These settings let you control how long classes remain visible in your registration form in the following situations:

When a class reaches capacity – choose whether it should still appear or be hidden.

Before the course starts – set the number of hours in advance when the course should be hidden from your website’s course catalogue.

Alert: 

Hiding the course before it starts will disable the option to allow late registration in the Price and Payment tile.

Class settings

Here, you can choose which classes from your list should appear in the menu on your website as available for online registration. This is especially useful when launching a new set of classes and you want to open online registration for multiple classes at once.

Customizing registration form

If you need different field names for this course’s registration form, you can set them in the 

Customizing the Registration Form 

section. This is useful when certain courses require specific field labels that differ from your standard registration form.

Communication

Communication plays an important role throughout the course. Each registration type has its own specific communication settings, in addition to a standard set of email templates you can use.

Email templates and signature

Select which templates to use for:

Confirmation email

Lead collection confirmation

Session reminders

Preset signature

Info:

 Information about how to work with email templates is available in this

Notification about upcoming sessions

For

 only Zooza provides an additional email notification for upcoming sessions with available slots possible for booking.

Notification to waiting lists about available slot

If your 

one-session course 

is full and you allow clients to join a waiting list, you can set up an automatic notification to inform them when a spot becomes available due to a cancellation.

Automatic waiting list notification.
