Personas

Personas 

is a feature that distinguishes between attendees and clients, giving each their own dedicated profile. Instead of treating a child (or other attendee) as just an extra field on a registration form, Personas creates a full record for them — complete with progress notes, order history, and family relationships. This provides a clearer, more detailed overview of each person’s engagement, helping you track their journey and interactions over time.

Person creation

Person can be created in 2 ways:

Automatically during registration

Manually within the application

There are 2 types of persons you can work with:

Client 

– the email address used to create the registration

Attendee 

– the person who actually attends the course

Example:

 In children’s courses, the client is typically the parent, while the attendee is the child.

Automatic creation

When a person is created automatically during registration, the system follows these rules:

The person who enters the email and basic details is always the 

Client

.

The Client is also an 

Attendee 

unless the course requires the

 Full Name

 and/or

 Date of Birth 

fields.

If the Client is not attending (e.g., a parent registering a child), they must fill in the additional fields including 

Full Name

 and/or 

Date of Birth

 for each 

Attendee

.

Manual registration

Sometimes an administrator may need to manually register a client for a course. To do this, follow these steps:

Select the class you want to register the client for.

Choose the client type:

Existing client 

- search for the client in the search box and click on their name

New client 

- enter their email address and click 

Continue 

to create a new registration

If registering an existing client:

Select who will be the attendee — the client themselves or another person linked to their email address.

If the attendee is not yet in Zooza, select

 Create New, 

fill in the required fields and click 

Continue

If registering a new client:

Fill in all required fields for the new client

Choose who will be the attendee - the client or another person

If the client is not attendee, uncheck the Client is also an attendee box and enter attendee’s first and last name.

Click 

Continue

.

Change of attendee

If a registration has the wrong attendee, you can update it in the 

Registration Detail 

view.

In the 

Attendee 

tile, click 

Change 

to select a different attendee for the registration.

If the correct attendee already exists in Zooza, select them from the list.

If the attendee does not yet exist in Zooza under this email, click 

Create

, fill in the required fields for the new attendee, and then click 

OK

.

Client Card

To view a client (whether the registrant or attendee) in full detail, Zooza provides a  

Client Card

. This feature lets you see the client’s complete history — including registrations, orders, credits, and notes written by instructors during attendance. You can also edit the client’s information or merge duplicate client cards if necessary.

Access a Client Card

Go to the 

Clients 

tab and search for the client by name, email, or other details.

From a registration detail page, click the

 Go to Attendee

 button.

Client Card detail

Once in the Client Card, you can:

Edit client information

 by clicking 

Edit 

in the tiles containing basic details.

Note:

 This action can only be performed if the 

Client 

is not the same as the 

Attendee

. If they are the same person, you must submit a new request, which will need to be approved by Zooza.

      2. 

Manage family & connections

 by creating or editing relationships between clients.

      

      3. 

View History,

 which includes all internal notes, a list of registrations, orders, and a credit overview.

      

Family & Connection

Each client or attendee can be linked to other people in Zooza (e.g., Parent–Child, Guardian, Spouse).

To manage relationships, open the person’s Client Card and click 

Manage 

in the 

Family & Connections 

section.

Merge Profiles

If you find duplicate records for the same person, you can merge them into a single profile.

Select all duplicate entries and click

 Merge profiles

Select the main person to keep as primary to merge records together

Click 

Save 

to complete the merge.

Tip:

 Before saving, review names, contact details, and other fields so the main profile reflects the correct information.

Edit relationship

If a relationship was created incorrectly, you can update it.

In 

Family & Connections,

 select the member whose relationship you want to change and click

 Edit Relationship

.

Choose the correct relationship from the drop down lists (e.g., Parent, Child, Guardian, Spouse).

Click 

Save

, then 

OK 

to confirm.

Client records

Attendance 

page includes a feature button for all attendees where it is possible to write a internal note about that event - e.g. progress on the session, homework, etc. addressing only the one particular attendee. 

By clicking on the 

Client Card

 button you will see the full overview of customer records created by instructors for a better understanding.

You can search in the notes or create a new one by clicking the 

New Message

 button.When creating a new message that is important for all instructors and admins, you can pin the message by ticking the checkbox.

Info:

 All messages created during attendance are visible in the client card in client's detail.
