Xero Integration in Zooza: Setup & Invoice Management

Setup & Invoice Management Guide

This guide explains how to connect 

Xero with Zooza

, how to configure VAT, accounts, and billing profiles, and how invoices behave in different scenarios (VAT payer / non-VAT payer, manual vs automatic invoices).

The goal of this integration is simple:

Invoices created in Zooza are automatically created and marked as paid in Xero when a payment is recorded.

1. Connecting Xero to Zooza

To connect Xero:

1. Go to 

Zooza → Settings → Billing "Invoice Settings" and choose Xero.  

→ 

Click 

Connect Xero

2. Log in to your Xero account and Allow Access

Once connected, you can:

Sync data at any time using 

Sync

Zooza will pull tax rates, bank accounts, and revenue accounts from Xero

✅ No additional setup is required at this stage.

2. VAT Sync (Only if You Are a VAT Payer)

If you are a 

VAT payer

:

Go to 

Zooza → Settings → Billing (to bottom of the page)

Click 

Sync VAT

Zooza will load VAT / tax rates from Xero

If you are 

not a VAT payer

, you can skip this step entirely.

3. Tax Setup in Xero (Important)

In Xero, you must have a 

tax rate correctly assigned

 to your revenue accounts.

Best practice:

Assign the tax rate to a 

revenue account

, e.g.

 

200 – Sales

 (or your preferred sales account)

If:

A 

new tax rate

 is created in Xero

 → Simply return to Zooza and click 

Sync

 at the bottom of the Billing page. (

Zooza → Settings → Billing (to bottom of the page))

4. Invoice Profile – VAT Settings

Go to 

Zooza → Billing → Invoice Profiles (Click on the Not Set or name of the invoice profile to go to the detail) 

If you ARE a VAT payer:

Enable 

Tax payer

Select the 

tax rate

 (synced from Xero)

If you are NOT a VAT payer:

Leave 

Tax payer unchecked

No tax rate is required

5. Bank Account Setup (Very Important)

At the bottom of the 

Invoice Profile

:

Select a 

Bank Account

 (synced from Xero)

Important rules:

The bank account 

must exist in Xero

It must be created as a 

Bank Account

It 

must have a code

 (any code is fine)

If the bank account:

Is created later in Xero → refresh Zooza

Invoices cannot be edited in Zooza after creation.

 

Changes made in Xero are not synchronised back to Zooza.

 

Paid invoices in Xero have very limited edit options due to accounting and VAT rules.

If no bank account is selected:

The invoice 

will be created in Xero

But it 

will NOT be automatically marked as paid in Xero

Next, select a 

Revenue Account

 from Xero.

This account:

Represents the income (e.g. Sales)

Has a 

tax rate assigned in Xero

Must match

 the tax rate selected in the Billing Profile

You can view and manage these accounts directly in Xero:

Xero 

→ 

Accounting 

→ 

 Chart

 of Accounts → All Accounts

6. Save the Billing Profile

Once all settings are complete:

Click 

Save

What This Setup Achieves

With the setup above:

Every invoice 

created in Zooza based on a payment

Is automatically:

Created in Xero

Marked as 

Paid 

 → 

Paid invoices in Xero have very limited edit options due to accounting and VAT rules.

Linked to the correct bank and revenue account

This works for:

Online payments

Manually recorded payments (if invoicing is enabled)

Manual Invoice Creation (Optional)

You can also create invoices 

manually

.

Where:

In the 

Booking detail

Or when 

adding a manual payment

How:

Select the 

period

 the invoice covers

Generate the invoice

Optionally 

send it to the client

This is useful when:

Payment was received outside Zooza

Cash or bank transfer was used

Automatic Invoice Creation (Optional)

You can enable 

Automatic Invoice Creation 

Go to 

Zooza → Settings → Billing "Automatic invoice generation upon payment"

When enabled:

An invoice is created 

automatically

Every time a payment is recorded on a booking

No manual action required.

Editing Invoices

Important limitation:

Invoices 

must be edited in Xero 

Changes 

do NOT sync back to Zooza

Zooza always keeps the 

original reference

.

Where to See Invoices

Zooza:

 → Invoices section (overview & links)
