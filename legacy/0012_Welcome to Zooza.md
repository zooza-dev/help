Sending email/SMS to clients

For effective communication with your clients, you can use the possibilities offered by the application itself. This way of communication is quick and easy.

The biggest advantage is that you can find 

every sent and received e-mail/SMS

 in the client details or in the message overview, so you know exactly what was communicated and when.

Overview of messages

To view the total communication for all your clients, please follow these steps:

click on the 

Communication 

tab and then on the 

Messages Overview

 option

In the message overview, messages can be filtered by:

email or phone number,

type - received-emails, sent-emails, SMS messages,

templates - by the name of the message template,

condition - unread, to do, solved

and sort them from newest or oldest.

Clicking on the client's email will take you to the details of the communication with the selected client.

You can also access this communication detail on the other side by searching for a specific registration and then clicking on the Communication button in the Communication section. In this section you have the possibility to send a new message (the procedure can be found at the end of this manual) and the possibility to view the history of sent e-mails/SMS, the possibility of filtering, view the content of sent and received messages, an overview of whether the messages have been read or handled by you.

A red ball with a number directly in the menu indicates whether you have received a new message from a client.

When you click on the bullet, you will see a list of unread messages. To view a specific message, you need to click on the client's email.

Sending messages

The procedure for sending emails and SMS is the same, please follow the following steps:

click on the 

Communication

 tab and then on the 

Send Email/Send SMS

 field

select a Target group

check the 

Promotional message

 box if your message is a promotional message. This setting will cause that if any client is unsubscribed from receiving advertising messages, they will not receive them. Unsubscribing of advertising messages is set in the registration details of each client. If you want to send a message to all clients including the ones who have the additional access to registrations (can be set in registration detail) click on the below checkbox ´

Send email also to users with additional access to registration.

Choose who you want to send the message to 

Clients - if a client has multiple registrations, he/she will receive this email only once

Registrations - whether you need to include specific information about each registration and therefore if a client has multiple registrations, he/she will also receive more emails with regards to each registration

If you selected a specific group as your target group, please select the group you want to send the message to

In the next step, you have the option to write the message itself. First, you can choose whether you want to send an already prepared message using templates or you want to create your text. For custom text, we've created a feature called dynamic tags within the templates to help you speak to clients more easily. You can select these tags by clicking the 

Tags

 button in the formatting panel. You can read about how these tags work in the manual 

Dynamic tags

.

Select template/message type:

You will then be taken to a summary screen where you can check your selections.

Click 

Continue 

and finally 

Send Message to

 send your message.

Note:

 To check each sent email, we recommend that you include your email.

Attention!

 Zooza does not function as a marketing communications system that allows clients to opt-out of receiving marketing/promotional messages. It is also not used to obtain information about how many clients have opened the promotional e-mail or responded to the attached links in the body of the message, or how many clients unsubscribed. The 

Promotional Email / Promotional SMS

 function is for customer information only. In case a client would like to unsubscribe from receiving promotional emails, you can do it based on his request as follows:

- in the 

Clients 

section, open the client account and click on 

Notes and preferences

- 

 untick the 

 

Send promotional emails

 box

How to send email/SMS to one client?

You also have this option in the procedure described above, but that procedure assumes that you know the email to which you want to communicate.

When communicating to a specific client, proceed as follows:

in the 

Registrations

 tab, click on the name of the client you want to communicate to.

in the client registration details, click on the 

E-mail or SMS

 button in the 

Communication

 section, or click on 

Communication

When you click the Email and SMS buttons, the recipient's details will automatically fill-in in the next screen.

The next procedure for sending an email/SMS is identical to the one described above. Please follow it.

Pozor!

 If no communication has been sent to the client, a notification about this fact will be displayed in the overview of sent messages for the given registration.

How to set the sender name for SMS

For SMS, you have the option to set the name of the SMS. This is the name under which the message appears on his phone, i.e. the name of the sender.

To set the name for SMS, see the 

Settings

 category under 

General settings
