2 lecturers per group

Do you have 2 lecturers in one group, or a main lecturer and his assistant?




The first lecturer is added when the group is created. A group is added by clicking on the 

Create new group

 button in the details of the specific course for which the group is being created







In the basic settings while creating a new group 

select 1. lecturer from the offer of lecturers. 

The lecturer can be changed later in the group settings.







Then in the group settings you have the option to add a second lecturer. Click on 

Groups

. Find and click on the group in which you want to manage the settings, and in the Lecturers tile, click 

Change

. This will open the Lecturers settings, where you have the option to 

Add additional lecturer




Select the following:

Lecturer

Lecturer Role

 - select whichever role is appropriate for your course and type of lecturer collaboration. The choice of role has no influence on the administration. This role is also displayed in the group details for the client.

Term Settings:

Change on group only - this setting will not change on terms

Change on all dates

Change on upcoming dates only - if you are adding a second tutor during the course, we recommend selecting this option for proper setup and calculation of rates.




For lecturers, you can also use rate functionality. Thus, you can 
calculate rewards for lecturers within the app. You will especially 
appreciate this setting if you have multiple lecturers working at 
different intensities. Please refer to 

the instructions for

 more information.
