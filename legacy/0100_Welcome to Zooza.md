Info:

 If you need to connect multiple Számlázz accounts to a single Zooza account, you can do this by linking each Számlázz account to a separate invoice profile. This way, you can create multiple invoice profiles in Zooza, with each one connected to its own Számlázz account. To set this up, simply add the token in the invoice profile settings, at the bottom of the page.
