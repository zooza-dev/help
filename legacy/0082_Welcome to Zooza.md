How to assign Direct Debit mandates to registrations (GoCardless)

After the import, you can assign 

existing Direct Debit mandates

 to the imported bookings.

Link existing Direct Debit mandates (Migration)

Linking mandates is safe — 

no money will be collected

 until a payment plan is created later.

Quick step-by-step

Go to 

Payments 

Click 

Direct Debit

 (top menu)

Click 

Migration

 

You will see this option only if:

Your 

GoCardless account is connected

, and (If not > Zooza (Team & Settins) > Settings > Payments)

At least one programme previously used 

Direct Debit

A list of 

all Direct Debit mandates not yet linked in Zooza

 will be displayed

Click 

Link

 next to a mandate

Choose

 the 

correct booking

 for that mandate

Confirm OK

Once linked:

The mandate is 

connected to the booking

It will 

disappear from the migration list

No payment will be taken

 at this point

💡 Payments are collected 

only after

 a payment plan is manually created in the next step.

Doing this early allows us later to 

simply apply payment plans to bookings

, without any additional setup.

Create payment plans

Option A: Apply a payment template to the whole group (recommended)

For each group:

Open the group

Go to 

Price & Payments

Click 

“Apply payment template”

Set the amount (based on the group)

Select 

start date: e.g. 1 January 2026

Choose which bookings it applies to (usually all)

Confirm and continue

Option B: Create payment plans manually per registration (

Guide

)

The logic is the same, just done individually.
