Client import

When you are a new client, or if you need to move existing clients from one Zooza account to another, the 

Client Import

 feature can save you time.

Important:

 Before starting the import, make sure the required courses and classes are already created in Zooza. Clients can only be imported into existing classes.

Import to Zooza

In Zooza, go to the 

Clients 

tab in the menu and click 

Import

.

Create a new import by clicking the 

Import 

button.

Upload

 

the

 .csv

 file you prepared.

Map the spreadsheet headers to the corresponding Zooza fields (as shown in the example image) and click 

Continue

.

If the classes already exist in Zooza, assign clients to the appropriate classes and click 

Continue

.

Zooza will validate each row of your spreadsheet and notify you if any 
data is incorrectly formatted. You can then adjust your spreadsheet and 
re-import the file.

Notes:

If you do not assign a class, the client will be created in Zooza but no registration will be created.

You can perform a partial import from your spreadsheet to verify that you are importing the correct clients into the right classes.

The import process may take some time, depending on the number of rows in your spreadsheet. You can track the progress and status of the import in the List of Imports.
