Automatic reminders for payment schedule

If the client has selected payment with a payment template in the registration or you have set it up manually, he will always be informed of this obligation in time - automatically by the application. Reminders will go to the client in the form of an email notification. You will learn how to set up payment templates in this 

manual.
