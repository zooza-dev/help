## Summary

| Check | Status | Files passing | Files failing |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Required frontmatter fields | PASS | 146 | 0 |
| 2. Unique slugs | PASS | 146 | 0 |
| 3. Unique intercom_id values | PASS | 131 set, all unique | 0 |
| 4. Exactly one H1 per doc | PASS | 146 | 0 |
| 5. No skipped heading levels | PASS | 146 | 0 |
| 6. No broken internal links | PASS | 146 | 0 |
| 7. All referenced assets exist on disk | PASS | 146 | 0 |
| **Informational** | | | |
| Docs flagged `needs_screenshot_replacement: true` | INFO | — | 17 |
| Obsidian `![[...]]` syntax present in content | PASS | — | 0 |

**Overall result: PASS — no blocking issues found.**

> Note: A previous run of this report (generated by an earlier script) incorrectly reported 56 missing assets.
> Those assets all exist in `assets/images/`. The earlier script had a regex bug that included the Markdown
> image title (the quoted string after the path) as part of the filename, producing false-positive failures.
> This report corrects that error.

## Check 1: Required Frontmatter Fields

Required fields checked:

- `title`
- `slug`
- `type`
- `product_area`
- `audience`
- `tags`
- `status`
- `source_language`
- `needs_screenshot_replacement`
- `last_converted`

**Result: PASS** — All 146 files have all required frontmatter fields present and parseable as valid YAML.

---

## Check 2: Unique Slugs

**Result: PASS** — No duplicate slugs found across all 146 documents.

---

## Check 3: Unique intercom_id Values

131 out of 146 documents have an `intercom_id` set; 15 do not (new docs not yet synced to Intercom).

**Result: PASS** — All 131 intercom_id values are unique. No duplicates detected.

---

## Check 4: Exactly One H1 Per Document

**Result: PASS** — Every document has exactly one `# H1` heading. No document is missing an H1 or has multiple H1s.

---

## Check 5: No Skipped Heading Levels

Heading level jumps (e.g. H1 directly to H3 without an intervening H2) were checked across all documents.

**Result: PASS** — No heading level skips detected in any document.

---

## Check 6: No Broken Internal Links

All relative `.md` links within `content/` were resolved against the filesystem.

**Result: PASS** — No broken internal links found.

---

## Check 7: Referenced Assets Exist

All image references (`![alt](path)`) were resolved relative to each file's location and checked for existence.
Image paths use the pattern `../../assets/images/<filename>` from `content/<type>/` directories.

**Result: PASS** — All referenced asset files exist on disk.

Total images in `assets/images/` (root): 549 files
Total images in `assets/images/reference/`: 161 files

## Informational: Screenshot Replacement Needed

The following 17 documents have `needs_screenshot_replacement: true`. These documents are published but
contain screenshots that should be replaced (typically Slovak-language UI screenshots). This does not
block publishing, but replacement is recommended.
