Includes a **Mark all as attended** button to set all clients to \"Attended\" in one click. Displays an attended count (e.g. \"Attended 3/5\") so you can see progress at a glance.\n- **Full view** — the detailed attendance panel. Shows everything from Quick view plus: make-up session selection, cancellation reasons, attendance notes, replacement credits, and waiting list management.\n\nBoth views are fully functional — Quick view is not a \"limited\" mode. It simply hides the details you don't need when all you want is to quickly mark who showed up. You can switch between views at any time without losing data.\n\n**When to use Quick view:** Daily attendance marking when you just need to check off who came. Especially useful on mobile or when an instructor needs to mark attendance fast before/after a session.\n\n**When to use Full view:** When you need to handle cancellations with make-up credits, add attendance notes, manage replacement sessions, or review detailed attendance history."}

Set the rate duration to 60 minutes.\n- **Per-student** — <!-- REVIEW: Confirm whether per-student rates are natively supported or require manual calculation via the instructor report. -->\n\nEach rate is created once and then assigned a monetary value per instructor — so the same rate (e.g., \"Group Session\") can pay different amounts to different instructors.

Click it to convert the trial into a full paid booking. The client can also do this themselves through the enrolment link sent by the trial automation.\n2. **Trial still in progress:** If the trial registration is still active (for example, in \"Trial Started\" state), the system will **not** allow a new registration with the same email into the same group. The trial must first reach a final state — either \"Trial Won\" or \"Trial Lost\" — before a new registration is possible.\n\nTo move a trial to a final state manually, change the registration status to **Trial Lost** (or **Trial Won** if they attended). After that, either use the **Start registration** button on the existing registration or have the client go through the booking form again."}

Replacement sessions have their own queue. When all available replacement slots for a session are full, clients can join the queue for one or more sessions. When a spot opens up, the client receives a notification with a confirmation link. Only after the client clicks the link is the replacement booking confirmed.\n\nThis is a fully automated process. To enable or disable the replacement waiting list, go to the programme settings and open the replacement (make-up) session settings. For example: **Programmes** → select a programme → **Settings** → **Make-up sessions** → **Make-up sessions waitlist**. <!-- REVIEW: verify exact setting label in current UI -->\n\nWhen the waitlist is disabled, clients only see sessions that currently have a free spot."}
