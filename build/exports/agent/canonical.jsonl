If a client is enrolled in a group that has lessons every Tuesday, they will receive a reminder on Monday that there is a lesson/event tomorrow.\n\nThe reminder is helpful for several reasons:\n\n- Clients may forget what day it is in the rush of daily responsibilities.\n- It informs them of the time and place -- especially useful for replacement lessons that take place at a different time or location.\n- Reminders can go to an additional email, for example to remind the other parent about the child's event. This helps when parents have alternating care. The additional email can be added by the client in their profile, or you can do it at the registration level.\n- Most importantly -- **a reminder allows the client to log out of the lesson with one click**. If they are home sick, it is very easy to forget to log out via their profile.\n- An automatic reminder with an opt-out option ensures clients do not forget to opt out, creating a spot in the group for someone who wants to use a replacement lesson.\n\nA sample reminder email:\n\n![Sample event reminder email](../../assets/images/sample-event-reminder-email.png \"Sample event reminder email\")\n\nYou can easily edit the text in the administration.

You can customize each widget to suit your needs - you can filter the course offerings, set specific parameters or change the look and feel according to your site design.Widget integration and configuration options:\n\n1. WordPress plugin – ideal solution if your website runs on the WordPress platform.\n2. Embed version (HTML code) –copy the generated HTML code directly into your page.\n\n\nTypes of widgets available:\n\n\n1. Registration form\n2. Calendar\n3. Profile\n4. Videos\n5. Product/Order form\n6. Map widget\n\n![Screenshot](../../assets/images/customizing-widgets-01.png)\n\n\nTIP: Think about the navigation on your site, it's best to place some of the subpages you create directly in the menu so that visitors can navigate as quickly as possible. We also recommend having your profile highlighted in the menu and it can be called anything you like - attendance, my profile, client profile.. for example like this:\n\n\n![Screenshot](../../assets/images/customizing-widgets-02.png)"}

This feature is available as a setting that, when activated, applies to all lecturer roles and accesses. Its main goal is to simplify the substitution process by allowing lecturers to manage schedule changes themselves without the need for administrator interaction.\n\nOnce activated, lecturers have the flexibility to set up a substitute on a selected term when they are unavailable, increasing their independence and efficiency in organising teaching. The administrator does not need to manually interfere with the process, which saves time and streamlines schedule management. The function is designed to facilitate coordination between lecturers and ensure smooth running of courses even in case of unplanned changes (illness,...)."}

It is important to note that this amount owed does not change automatically thereafter. So, for example, by adjusting the price of a group or course, you will not change the amount owed on registrations that have already been created. This is mainly because if the amount of the exchange rate were to change over time in this way, even historically old registrations would suddenly become outstanding because the amount of payments made would not match the amount owed.\n\nIt follows that the amount owed does not always have to match the price of the course-group."}

The payment is imported into Zooza, but it is not paired because no debt existed at that time.\n- Overpayment: The customer pays a higher amount than the current outstanding balance. In this case, the payment is also not paired automatically.\n\nIn these situations, Zooza does not attempt to re-pair the payment automatically later — even if a debt is created afterwards or the amount due changes.\n\nYou can always check the exact reason why a payment was not paired directly in the payment detail, in the field “Pairing process summary”.\n\nSolution: Such payments can be safely paired manually to the correct booking, typically using the *payment reference*."}
