If a client is enrolled in a group that has lessons every Tuesday, they will receive a reminder on Monday that there is a lesson/event tomorrow.\n\nThe reminder is helpful for several reasons:\n\n- Clients may forget what day it is in the rush of daily responsibilities.\n- It informs them of the time and place -- especially useful for replacement lessons that take place at a different time or location.\n- Reminders can go to an additional email, for example to remind the other parent about the child's event. This helps when parents have alternating care. The additional email can be added by the client in their profile, or you can do it at the registration level.\n- Most importantly -- **a reminder allows the client to log out of the lesson with one click**. If they are home sick, it is very easy to forget to log out via their profile.\n- An automatic reminder with an opt-out option ensures clients do not forget to opt out, creating a spot in the group for someone who wants to use a replacement lesson.\n\nA sample reminder email:\n\n![Sample event reminder email](../../assets/images/sample-event-reminder-email.png \"Sample event reminder email\")\n\nYou can easily edit the text in the administration.
