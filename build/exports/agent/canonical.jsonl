For more information on exactly how to work with this functionality, see *Using a link with a dynamic tag *in this manual section below.

This is handy when organizing various online sessions such as Zoom meetings or when sharing private documents. You can find the full list of dynamic tags [here](dynamic-tags.md).\nTo use a dynamic tag, follow these steps:\n\n1.

This gives you a 5-day buffer before expiry.\n- **Watch for the Zooza notification email.** Zooza sends a reminder before your connection expires. Make sure these emails are not going to spam.\n- **Check the payments dashboard regularly.** If you notice that no new payments have appeared for several days, your connection may have expired.\n- **Consider email-notification pairing.** If renewing every 90 days is inconvenient or if your bank has known GoCardless issues, email-notification pairing eliminates the renewal cycle entirely.\n- **Keep GoCardless and email-notification pairing mutually exclusive.** Do not run both methods on the same bank account at the same time. This causes duplicate transactions in Zooza."}

The payment is imported into Zooza, but it is not paired because no debt existed at that time.\n- Overpayment: The client pays a higher amount than the current outstanding balance. In this case, the payment is also not paired automatically.\n\nIn these situations, Zooza does not attempt to re-pair the payment automatically later — even if a debt is created afterwards or the amount due changes.\n\nYou can always check the exact reason why a payment was not paired directly in the payment detail, in the field “Pairing process summary”.\n\nSolution: Such payments can be safely paired manually to the correct booking, typically using the *payment reference*."}

If your franchise has separate Zooza accounts for each location, a person needs a separate user record in each account.\n- An instructor who works at multiple locations needs to be added as a team member in each account with the appropriate role.\n- When deactivating an instructor across multiple locations, remember to set them to Inactive in **every** account where they are listed.\n- The Receptionist role is well-suited for location managers who need to check clients in and add payments but should not have access to programme configuration or financial reports.\n- If a location manager needs broader access (e.g., editing the timetable, communicating with all clients), use the Assistant role for that location's account."}

If you do not use blocks, Zooza now displays group capacity instead of session capacity by default. Verify your widget is using the latest behaviour.\n2. To control the capacity display, go to **Publish** > select your widget > **Calendar** settings and check the occupancy display option.\n3.

Account deactivation stops notifications and new registrations, but existing widget code still renders and clients can reach the login screen.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Remove all Zooza embed code and widget scripts from your website pages.\n2. If using the WordPress plugin, deactivate and uninstall it.\n3. Once the widget code is removed, the URLs become inactive and clients can no longer access the forms."}

Email links sent to clients also stop working because they point to your website.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Contact Zooza support to request a temporary redirect to a Zooza Sites page (e.g. `zooza.site/your-business-name`).\n2. Zooza support can update the widget URLs so that all outgoing emails point to the temporary Zooza Sites page.\n3. Once your website is back online, contact support again to revert the URLs to your original domain."}

Go to **Settings** > **Publish** and verify every URL.\n- **Widget design customization** is handled via CSS on your website. Refer to `https://docs.zooza.online` for available CSS classes and overrides.\n- **One widget per page:** Avoid placing multiple instances of the same widget type on a single page."}
