However, block capacity is calculated **per block**. Because the system does not know which specific block the trial client will eventually join, it cannot accurately reserve a per-block seat. In practice this means:\n\n1. A trial booking may fill a session slot at the group level.\n2. A paying client then registers for a specific block in the same group.\n3. The system prioritises the paying client (confirmed revenue) over the trial (non-binding), which can push the session over its per-block capacity.\n\n**Workaround:** Go to **Programme → Settings → Trial** and configure trial bookings to use **extra capacity** only. This ensures that trial reservations never consume spots intended for paying clients. The trial client is added on top of the normal capacity limit instead of inside it.\n\nIf you prefer to keep the current setting, you will need to manage overbooking manually — for example, by contacting the trial client and moving them to a different session that still has available spots."}

The exact flow depends on the trial status:\n\n1. **Trial ended (Trial Won / Trial Lost):** Open the registration detail. You will see a **Start registration** button. Click it to convert the trial into a full paid booking. The client can also do this themselves through the enrolment link sent by the trial automation.\n2. **Trial still in progress:** If the trial registration is still active (for example, in \"Trial Started\" state), the system will **not** allow a new registration with the same email into the same group. The trial must first reach a final state — either \"Trial Won\" or \"Trial Lost\" — before a new registration is possible.\n\nTo move a trial to a final state manually, change the registration status to **Trial Lost** (or **Trial Won** if they attended).

A paying client can still register for the full course or a specific block.\n3. The system prioritises the paying client, even if this causes temporary over-capacity.\n\n**Workaround:** Configure trial bookings to use **extra capacity** only (in the programme's trial session settings at **Programme -> Settings -> Trial**). This ensures trials do not consume spots reserved for paying clients.\n\nThere is currently no way to assign a trial to a specific block. The trial client must decide which block to join only after converting to a full registration."}

In Zooza, it means the system divides the full price by the total number of sessions, then multiplies by the remaining sessions. The result is a fair, pro-rated price for clients who join after the programme starts.\n\n**Q: Where do I configure aliquot pricing?**\nA: Go to **Programmes** → select the programme → **Edit Settings** → **Price and Payment** → **Advanced settings** → `Aliquot price calculation`.\n\n**Q: Can the system automatically switch from full price to pro-rata after a certain date?**\nA: No. The system applies whichever setting is currently active. To switch, you must manually change the `Aliquot price calculation` setting on the programme at the time you want the change to take effect.\n\n**Q: Is the pro-rata price visible to clients during booking?**\nA: The calculated price may not always be shown on the booking form. Clients typically see the price after the booking is completed or when payment instructions are sent. Check your programme's late booking flow (automatic vs. manual approval) to understand when the price is communicated.\n\n\n\n**Q: What happens if I change the aliquot setting mid-term?**\nA: The change applies only to new late bookings created after the setting is changed. Existing bookings keep their original calculated price."}

The payment is imported into Zooza, but it is not paired because no debt existed at that time.\n- Overpayment: The client pays a higher amount than the current outstanding balance.
