# WhatsApp troubleshooting

Common issues when setting up or using WhatsApp integration in Zooza.

## "Connect to WhatsApp" button missing

Your plan may not include WhatsApp, or it is not enabled on your account. **Contact us** to enable it.

## "Not an admin" or cannot select Business

Ask your Facebook organisation owner to grant you **Business Admin** rights for the correct Business Account.

## Number already in use

Disconnect the number from all other platforms (including the **WhatsApp Business mobile app**) before connecting to the API.

## Template approval delays

Meta review can take time. Keep copy clear and compliant. You can switch language variants after approval.

## No messages arriving

Verify the following:

1. Connection status in Zooza
2. Business verification
3. Template approval
4. That you are messaging from/to the **connected number**
