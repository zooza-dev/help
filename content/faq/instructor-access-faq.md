# Instructor Access and Roles FAQ

## How do instructors log in to Zooza?

Instructors go to your Zooza app URL (e.g., `asia.zooza.app`), enter their email address, and receive a secure login link by email. There is no password — they click the link to access the system.

## An instructor did not receive the invitation email — what should I do?

1. Check that the email address is correct in **Settings → Team**.
2. Try sending a new invitation.
3. Ask the instructor to check their spam/junk folder.
4. If using a corporate email, there may be delivery delays.

Note: Instructors do not need a formal invitation to log in. If they are listed as an instructor in the system, they can go to the Zooza app URL and request a login link with their email.

## What can instructors see and do?

Instructor access depends on their role:

- **Standard instructor** — sees only their own classes in the Calendar view. Can mark attendance.
- **Lead instructor** — can see other instructors' classes and the wider timetable. Useful for cover planning and coordination.

Instructors do not have access to payment details, reports, or full booking management.

## How do I change instructor permissions?

Go to **Settings → Team**, select the instructor, and adjust their role. If you want all instructors to see each other's classes (e.g., for a small team that covers for each other), set them as lead instructors.

## How do I add Zooza to a phone as an app?

Zooza works as a web app. To make it behave like a native app on mobile:

1. Open the Zooza URL in the phone's browser (Safari on iPhone, Chrome on Android).
2. Tap the share/menu button.
3. Select **Add to Home Screen**.

This creates an app icon that opens Zooza directly without the browser navigation bar.
