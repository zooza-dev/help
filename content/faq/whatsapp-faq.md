# WhatsApp FAQ

## Do parents need to install an app?

No. They receive WhatsApp messages and follow links to your **website/Parent Portal**.

## Can we choose which events send on WhatsApp?

Core touchpoints are **pre-wired** and also send email. You can edit template **content/language**; triggers are fixed for consistency.

## Can we keep using our mobile WhatsApp Business app on the same number?

No. An API-connected number **cannot** be used in the mobile app. Many brands use two numbers (automation vs. ad-hoc mobile).

## How do we increase message limits?

Complete **Business Verification** in Facebook Business Manager to unlock higher tiers.
