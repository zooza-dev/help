# Attendance and Catch-up Classes FAQ

## How do instructors mark attendance?

Instructors log in to Zooza (via `zooza.app`), open their **Calendar**, and select the current session. They see a list of registered children and mark each as "attended" or "absent". Attendance can be marked from both mobile and desktop.

Tip: Instructors should add Zooza to their phone's home screen so it works like a native app.

## Can an admin mark attendance on behalf of a teacher?

Yes. As an admin, go to **Calendar**, select the session, and mark attendance for any class — including past sessions. Admins can see all classes, while instructors only see their own.

## How do catch-up / make-up classes work?

When a child misses a session (marked as absent or session was cancelled), the system can offer a make-up session. The parent selects from available catch-up sessions in their Parent Portal.

Catch-up availability is based on:

- Real class capacity — there must be space in the alternative session.
- Programme match — the catch-up must be within a compatible programme/age group.

If no suitable session is available, the parent will not see a catch-up option.

## Why can't a parent see catch-up options?

Check these common causes:

1. The absence was not properly recorded — the session needs to be marked as "Cancelled" or the child as "Absent" in attendance.
2. There are no sessions with available capacity in a compatible class.
3. The catch-up window may have expired based on your automation settings.

As an admin, you can verify and trigger the catch-up option by toggling the attendance status (e.g., "Will attend" → "Cancelled" again).

## What do the attendance numbers mean on the calendar?

On the calendar view, you may see numbers like "12/15" and "4":

- **12/15** — the number of enrolled children vs. total class capacity.
- **4** — how many are actually booked into that specific session (including trials).

Hover over the numbers for a detailed breakdown.

## Is attendance tracking important for automations?

Yes. Marking attendance triggers automations — especially for trials. When a teacher marks a trial attendee as "attended", the system automatically sends the enrolment offer to the parent.
