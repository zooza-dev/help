# Programmes, Timetables and Sessions FAQ

## What is the difference between programmes, timetables, and sessions?

- **Programme (Programme)** — the top-level entity (e.g., "Beginners Swimming"). It holds pricing, settings, and automation rules.
- **Timetable (Class/Class)** — a specific scheduled class within a programme (e.g., "Monday 9:00 AM at Main Hall"). It defines the recurring pattern, location, and instructor.
- **Sessions** — individual occurrences of a class (e.g., "Monday 6 January 9:00 AM"). Sessions are generated from the timetable and can be edited individually.

Changes made at the **timetable** level (e.g., assigning an instructor) do not always cascade to existing individual sessions. You may need to update sessions separately using bulk edit.

## How do I assign an instructor to sessions?

Assigning an instructor at the timetable level applies to future sessions. For existing sessions, use the **bulk edit** feature:

1. Go to the class detail.
2. Select the sessions you want to change.
3. Use bulk edit to assign the instructor.

## How do I change the time of a class?

You cannot change the time directly in the timetable settings for existing sessions. Instead:

1. Open the class detail.
2. Select the sessions that need the time change.
3. Use **bulk edit** to update the time.

You can choose whether to send a notification to parents about the change.

## How do I move a class to a different programme?

Open the class detail, go to **Settings / Edit → Other settings**, and change the programme from the dropdown. Save and refresh.

## How do I copy a class?

You can duplicate a class to create a similar one at a different time or location. When copying, double-check that all settings (price, payment methods, extra fields) have carried over correctly — some settings may need to be re-applied.

## How do I add a new class to an existing programme?

Go to the programme, click on the timetable section, and create a new timetable entry. You will need to set the schedule, location, and price. The price does not automatically copy from other classes in the same programme — it must be set explicitly.

## How do I hide a class from online registration?

In the class settings, you can toggle visibility for the online registration form. This keeps the class in the system for internal management but hides it from the public booking page.

## Why do changes I make not appear immediately?

Zooza uses browser caching to speed up page loading. When you create or edit something (like a location or class), the change may take a moment to appear. A quick browser refresh (Cmd+R on Mac, Ctrl+R on Windows) usually resolves this.
