# Email and Communication FAQ

## What is the difference between "Trial Booking Completed" and "Confirmation of Booking" emails?

- **Trial Booking Completed** — sent immediately after a parent books a trial class. It confirms the trial booking.
- **Confirmation of Booking** — sent after a parent completes a full programme enrolment (not a trial).

These are separate templates that serve different stages of the client journey.

## What dynamic tags can I use in emails?

Common dynamic tags:

- `*|FIRST_NAME|*` — parent's first name.
- `*|EF_FULL_NAME|*` — child's full name.
- `*|BOOKING_URL|*` — pre-filled booking form link.
- `*|WIDGET_PROFILE_URL|*` — secure direct-login link to the parent's profile.

The full tag list is available via the **Tags** button in the email editor. Some tags only work in specific template types (e.g., session tags only in session notifications).

## Do dynamic tags work in email subject lines?

Yes, but with limitations. Some tags may not populate in certain template types. Test your email before sending to a large class.

## Why does my email lose formatting when sent?

When composing emails in Zooza, the editor preserves formatting (paragraphs, bold, etc.). If the sent email appears as a single block of text, you may be pasting plain text without the correct line breaks. Use the built-in editor's formatting tools rather than pasting from external sources.

## Where do replies to Zooza emails go?

Replies go directly into the Zooza application. The reply-to address is system-managed and routes to your Zooza inbox.

## Can I use a custom sending domain for emails?

Custom sending domains are available for specific plans. Contact your Zooza account manager to discuss options.

## How do I send an email to all clients at a specific location?

Go to **Bookings**, filter by the relevant class or location, and use the bulk communication option. You can also go to **Communication** for broader email sends, though the filtering options differ from the bookings view.

## How do I set up class reminder emails for parents?

Class reminders are part of the automated email flow. They are configured per programme under the communication/automation settings. Typically, a reminder is sent the day before the scheduled session.

## Can I get an email notification when a new booking or trial comes in?

Yes. Admin notifications are configured in the system settings. You receive an email whenever a new booking (including trials) is created.
