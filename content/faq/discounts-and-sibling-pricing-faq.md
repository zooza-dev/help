# Discounts and Sibling Pricing FAQ

## How do I set up a discount code?

Go to **Payments → Discounts** and create a new code. You can configure:

- **Code name** — what the client enters (e.g., "SIBLING15").
- **Discount type** — percentage or absolute amount.
- **Usage limits** — single-use or unlimited.
- **Programme/location restrictions** — limit to specific programmes or locations.

Enable the discount code field on your registration form so clients can enter it during checkout.

## How do sibling discounts work?

There is no built-in automatic sibling detection yet. Currently, sibling discounts are handled manually using one of these approaches:

- **Discount code approach:** Create a single-use coupon and share it with parents who have multiple children. The parent applies it to the second child's booking.
- **Percentage split:** If the discount should apply to one child out of two registered together, use half the percentage (e.g., 7.5% instead of 15%) since the code applies to the entire order total.
- **Manual adjustment:** Register both children, then manually adjust the payment amount on one booking.

## Does a discount code apply per child or per order?

Discount codes apply to the **entire order total**, not per child. If a parent registers two children in one checkout, the discount is calculated on the combined amount. This means it gets split across both children, which can look different depending on how the booking was done.

## Can I use percentage discounts with monthly memberships?

For monthly memberships (recurring payments), percentage discounts do not work because there is no fixed total order value. Use **absolute discounts** instead (e.g., 50 AED off instead of 10%).

## How can I waive a registration fee for existing members?

Create a one-time discount code equal to the registration fee amount (e.g., code "MEMBER" for 100 AED off). Share it with existing clients when they re-register. They enter it during checkout, and the registration fee is deducted from their first payment.
