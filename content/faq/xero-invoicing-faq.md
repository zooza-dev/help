# Xero Integration FAQ

## Can I disable automatic invoice generation temporarily?

Yes. You can switch off automatic invoice generation so invoices are not sent to customers until your Xero settings (e.g., VAT rates) are fully configured. Customers will still receive payment confirmations.

## Can I generate invoices retroactively?

Yes. After you have finalized your Xero settings, you can go through existing bookings and generate invoices for all past payments. This allows you to launch bookings first and sort out invoicing later.

## My invoices show "tax exempt" — how do I fix VAT settings?

VAT rates are managed in your Xero account. Make sure the correct tax rate is set up in Xero, then re-sync the connection in Zooza under **Settings → Invoice Profiles**. After syncing, invoices will reflect the correct VAT rate.

## Where do I manage Xero connection settings?

Go to **Settings → Invoice Profiles** in Zooza. From there you can sync or re-sync your Xero connection and configure invoice settings.

## Do invoices get marked as paid automatically?

Zooza can automatically mark invoices as paid in Xero when the corresponding payment is received through Stripe. This feature needs to be enabled — contact support if it is not working on your account.
