# Waiting List FAQ

## How does the waiting list work?

When a class is full, parents can still submit a booking. Their booking is placed on a waiting list. You receive a notification, and you can manually approve the booking if a space becomes available. The system does not auto-enrol from the waiting list.

## Will parents see that a class is full before they start registering?

Yes. The booking form shows a "class full" indicator upfront. However, parents can still proceed with the form and submit a waiting list request at the bottom. Some parents may not scroll down to see this option — if this is an issue, you can share feedback with Zooza about the form design.

## How do I manage waiting list entries?

Go to **Bookings** and filter by waiting list status. From there you can:

- Approve a waiting list entry (if a spot has opened up).
- Move the person to a different class with availability.
- Contact the parent to offer alternatives.

## Is the waiting list enabled by default?

Yes. When a class reaches full capacity, the waiting list option is automatically available on the booking form. No additional configuration is needed.
