# Login and Account FAQ

## How do I delete my Zooza account entirely?

Account deletion must be handled by Zooza support. Contact support@zooza.online and request account deletion. Once processed, all data associated with the account is removed. If you decide to return later, you can create a new account.

<!-- REVIEW: Confirm whether self-service account deletion is planned or if support-only is the permanent approach. -->

## After changing an instructor's email, they cannot log in — what is the process?

When you update an instructor's email address in **Settings → Team**, the instructor must log in again using the new email:

1. Go to your Zooza app URL (e.g., `yourbusiness.zooza.app`).
2. Enter the **new** email address.
3. Click the login link that arrives by email.

No separate invitation is needed. The instructor simply requests a new login link with the corrected email. If the link does not arrive, check that the email address is spelled correctly in **Settings → Team** and ask the instructor to check their spam folder.

## A new account was created but not verified — how does verification work?

When a new business account is created in Zooza, it goes through a verification step before it becomes fully active. During verification, the Zooza team reviews the account details and approves it. If your account is stuck in an unverified state, contact support@zooza.online — they can check the status and approve it manually.

<!-- REVIEW: Clarify whether verification is automatic (email confirmation) or manual (Zooza team review) for all account types. The support data suggests manual approval is involved at least for network accounts. -->

## A client keeps creating new accounts on zooza.online instead of logging in through our website — what should I do?

This happens when a client goes to `zooza.online` (the main Zooza website) and creates a standalone account instead of using the registration or profile widget embedded on your website.

To prevent this:

- Direct clients to **your website** for registration and profile access, not to zooza.online.
- Embed the Zooza profile widget on your site so clients can log in and manage bookings from there.
- If a client already created a separate account on zooza.online, contact Zooza support to resolve duplicate accounts.

There is no way to block clients from visiting zooza.online directly, so clear communication about where to register is important.

## How do parents log in to their profile?

Zooza uses a **passwordless, token-based login**. Parents do not set or use a password. The process is:

1. The parent opens the profile widget on your website (or goes to your Zooza app URL).
2. They enter their email address.
3. Zooza sends a one-time login code to that email.
4. The parent enters the code to access their profile.

If a parent reports not receiving the code, ask them to check their spam folder. Login codes are sent almost instantly under normal conditions. There is no password to reset — every login uses a fresh email code.

## Can multiple team members share one login?

No. Each team member should have their own account with an individual email address. Shared logins create problems with audit trails, permissions, and notifications. To add team members:

1. Go to **Settings → Team**.
2. Add each person with their own email address.
3. Assign the appropriate role (owner, admin, instructor, etc.).

Each team member then logs in with their own email using the same passwordless login link process.

## How do I change the app language for admins or instructors?

On the Zooza app dashboard, click the **Zooza logo** (top-left). At the bottom of the menu, a language switcher is displayed. Click the language you want to use.

Available languages: Slovensky, English, Česky, Deutsch, Romanian.

The language change takes effect immediately and applies to the current user's session. Each admin or instructor can set their own preferred language independently.
