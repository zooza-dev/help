# Parent Portal FAQ

## How do parents log into the Parent Portal?

Parents go to your portal URL (e.g., `yourbrand.zooza.online/customer-portal/`), enter their email address, and receive a secure login link (token) by email. There is no password — each login sends a fresh email link.

## A parent says they are not receiving the login email — what should I do?

Check the following:

1. Confirm the email address matches what is registered in Zooza.
2. Ask the parent to check their spam/junk folder.
3. Try sending the login email again from the admin side.
4. If using a corporate or Outlook email, there may be filtering delays — the email usually arrives within a few minutes.

If the issue persists, contact support to check the email delivery logs.

## What can parents see and do in the Parent Portal?

Parents can:

- View their active bookings and upcoming sessions.
- Complete outstanding payments.
- Book catch-up / make-up classes (if enabled).
- View their child's attendance history.
- Access trial-to-enrolment offers.

If a parent has an outstanding balance, the first thing they see is a prompt to complete payment.

## A parent booked a trial but cannot see it in the portal — why?

There are two possibilities:

1. The parent submitted an **enquiry form** instead of a trial booking. Enquiries do not create a booking — they wait for admin follow-up. Check the enquiries filter in the bookings section.
2. The trial booking exists but the portal display may not be immediately obvious. Direct the parent to scroll down or check their email for the confirmation link.

## How do parents book catch-up / make-up classes?

When a session is cancelled or the parent marks an absence, the system can offer catch-up options. The parent sees available catch-up sessions in their portal and can select one. Catch-up availability depends on real capacity — if no suitable session with space is available, the option will not appear.
