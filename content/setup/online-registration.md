# Online registration

To control how the course is displayed on your website and how communication with clients is managed, use this setting. It includes three parts:


1. Online registration
2. Customizing the registration form
3. Communication

## Online registration

## Registration options

In the* Registration options* section you set the visibility on your website and in the registration form.you can control what is visible on your website and in the registration form. If your course includes a *Trial *or *Blocks*, you can decide exactly what you want clients to see.

Example: If you don’t want clients to choose between blocks and the full course, select the *Blocks only* option.

## Multiple registrations for the course


When you enable multiple registrations for a course, you can choose whose information you need to collect — only from the main registrant or from every participant.

We also recommend selecting the *Payments are managed by registrant *option in the *Price and Payment *tile. This ensures that all payments for the registrations are grouped under the main registration, using a single variable symbol, and allows clients to pay everything in one transaction.

## Other


These settings let you control how long classes remain visible in your registration form in the following situations:


1. When a class reaches capacity – choose whether it should still appear or be hidden.
2. Before the course starts – set the number of hours in advance when the course should be hidden from your website’s course catalogue.

Alert: Hiding the course before it starts will disable the option to allow late registration in the Price and Payment tile.

## Class settings

Here, you can choose which classes from your list should appear in the menu on your website as available for online registration. This is especially useful when launching a new set of classes and you want to open online registration for multiple classes at once.

## Customizing registration form


If you need different field names for this course’s registration form, you can set them in the *Customizing the Registration Form *section. This is useful when certain courses require specific field labels that differ from your standard registration form.

## Communication


Communication plays an important role throughout the course. Each registration type has its own specific communication settings, in addition to a standard set of email templates you can use.

## Email templates and signature


Select which templates to use for:

1. Confirmation email
2. Lead collection confirmation
3. Session reminders
4. Preset signature

Info: Information about how to work with email templates is available in this [manual](../guides/message-templates.md).

## Automatic email reminders


Choose whether the system should send a reminder to participants the day before each session.

## Notification to waiting lists about available slot


If your *one-session course *is full and you allow clients to join a waiting list, you can set up an automatic notification to inform them when a spot becomes available due to a cancellation.
