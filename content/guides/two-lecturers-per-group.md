# 2 lecturers per group

Do you have 2 lecturers in one group, or a main lecturer and his assistant?

1. The first lecturer is added when the group is created. A group is added by clicking on the Create new group button in the details of the specific course for which the group is being created

1. Select the following:
2. *Lecturer*
3. *Lecturer Role* - select whichever role is appropriate for your course and type of lecturer collaboration. The choice of role has no influence on the administration. This role is also displayed in the group details for the client.

Term Settings:


1. Change on group only - this setting will not change on terms
2. Change on all dates
3. Change on upcoming dates only - if you are adding a second tutor during the course, we recommend selecting this option for proper setup and calculation of rates.

For lecturers, you can also use rate functionality. Thus, you can
calculate rewards for lecturers within the app. You will especially
appreciate this setting if you have multiple lecturers working at
different intensities. Please refer to [the instructions for](https://www.zooza.online/support/setting-the-rate-reward-for-lecturer/) more information.
