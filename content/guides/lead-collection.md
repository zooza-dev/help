# Lead collection

A lead collection class is a class without dates. Use it to collect interest from clients before you have a schedule ready. For example, you want to launch a new programme but only if enough people are interested.

You set up lead collection at the class level by selecting the **Interested** option.

The class will also appear in the booking form with the option to register. Once you have enough applicants, define the dates and the lead collection class automatically becomes a regular class. Your clients will see all the information in their profiles.

This change also works retroactively — if you delete all dates from a class, it automatically changes back to a lead collection class.

You can see whether it is a lead collection class or a class with dates based on the name of the class.
