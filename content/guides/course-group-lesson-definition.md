# Programme, class, session definition

In real life, your clients sign up for a programme and then, when it starts, attend the programme within the agreed schedule. The moment you have more clients in one programme than you can handle, you naturally start to divide them into classes.
In the app, it works very similarly. First you need to create a programme. You will then add classes to the programme that your clients can join. When you create classes, you also create terms – a timetable, in which you will then record attendance.


For the whole process of creating a menu, there is a system available in the application that will help you step by step with the individual settings. More information can be found in the [documentation](https://support.zooza.online/portal/en/kb/articles/course-creation).

## Programme types

## Ongoing


An ongoing programme is one that has more than one session and clients sign up (register) for all sessions at the same time. A typical example might be a ceramics programme or a language programme.

## One-off


These are typically lectures, sessions, consultations or other meetings that have one specific date.

## Open


These are sessions where the client have an option to choose just one, more or all of the sessions according to their time and will. Consequently, he/she only pays for the sessions he/she attends. You can attach a possibility to buy a season ticket for this type of course The process for creating Open Programmes can be found in the [manual](open-course-creation.md).

## Classes

Depending on the type of course, the creation of classes differs in only one detail: for ongoing and open programmes, it is possible to enter multiple dates, while for one-off programmes, it is possible to enter only one date.
There is no limit to the number of dates in the ongoing and open programmes. So you can make two, but you can also make two hundred. How to create a class can be found in this [manual.](https://support.zooza.online/portal/en/kb/articles/group-creation)

## Schedules and sessions/sessions


Each class contains at least one term. If there are more terms, we can also call them schedules. The dates automatically determine the time range of the programme, when it starts and when it ends. All the steps for creating sessions/sessions into classes can be seen in this [link](https://support.zooza.online/portal/en/kb/articles/creating-events-in-groups).

## Billing periods


This is a very practical tool for companies that organise their programmes in semesters. For example, if you have five classes in the winter semester and seven in the spring semester, you can distinguish them from each other thanks to the billing periods. For example, in case you would like to offer to carry over replacement sessions between semesters.


You can use the billing periods at your discretion. Whether for the individual periods in which you create programmes. or for the whole school year. It is not necessary to use them, but it is a great tool.

## Example


Take the example of a primary school. Various subjects (programmes) are taught there. Subjects are taught in classes (classes) and when pupils go to school is determined by the schedule (sessions/sessions). The school year is divided into two parts, separated by report cards (billing periods).
