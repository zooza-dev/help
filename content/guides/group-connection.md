# Group connection

Group connection is a functionality that is used to merge classes within a programme that you want to work together in certain ways. This linking allows multiple classes to continue to function as one at several levels.

Currently this functionality is only available for open programmes. This is because, for now, the links only serve to make terms in multiple classes available in a single offering.

Example: if a client is enrolled in a Yoga programme, but you have an offer split into multiple classes: Mondays at 9:00am and Wednesdays at 6:00pm, then linking will allow them to select dates from both the Monday and Wednesday classes.

You will definitely benefit from classes connection even if you use a season pass product. Clients with linked classes can pay for dates from one season ticket.

This way you can create multiple connections within a single programme.
This allows you to be more variable in your programme offerings and the
application of products within them. It also allows you to make new
connections of new classes in new billing period.
