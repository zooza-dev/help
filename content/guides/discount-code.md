# Discount code

A discount code is one of the types of client discounts you will find
within the app. Typical use is within campaigns or collaborations, where
 you generate a code with a certain name and setting and those clients
who know it can use it.

Note: The discount can only be applied to programmes by
entering the code in the registration form. In order for clients to be
able to enter the code, you must enable the *Discount* field in the main settings under *Registration Forms – Registration Form*.

## Client use of discount code

The discount code can only be applied through the registration form located on your website.
 The client simply applies the code at booking by entering it and
can immediately check the amount of the discount you have given them.

form, the discount is only valid for programme booking, it does not
affect products.
