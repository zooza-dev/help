# Programme settings tile

Programme settings are pre-filled when you create the programme, but you can adjust them at any time. The settings are organised into several sections:


1. Basic information
2. Additional settings
3. Labels and colours
4. Gallery

## Basic information


In this section, you can define the core details of your programme:


1. *Programme name -* the name displayed to clients and used throughout the system.
2. *Product Code (SKU)* -if you are part of a network, this is the product code assigned by the master franchisor.
3. *URL address* where the programme description is more detailed
4. *Programme description*

## Additional settings

1. In the *Programme Type* section, you can adjust the format of the programme — for example, changing it to an online session, a photography programme, or a standard programme with scheduled sessions.
2. You can also update the *Target audience* if the programme changes from class classes to individual sessions, or vice versa.
3. Selecting the *For children* checkbox changes the wording in certain parts of the application. For example, in the booking form, “Name” will become “Parent’s Name.”

4. If you check the *Archive *box and save the settings, the programme will be removed from your active programme list and placed in the archive. A full explanation of this feature is available [HERE](https://support.zooza.online/portal/en/kb/articles/delete-archive-courses).

## Labels and colours

1. In the *Tag *field, you can optionally enter a category name for the programme. Tags are for your internal use only and help you organise and filter your programmes more easily. To save the tag, click OK next to the field. For more details on using tags, see the [Tags manual.](https://support.zooza.online/portal/en/kb/articles/labels-and-extra-fields)
2. You can also assign a programme colour (if it wasn’t set during the programme creation wizard) to help clients easily identify your programmes. For example, a programme for 3–4-year-olds could be set to “Zooza Orange,” making it instantly recognisable on the calendar, such as on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

## Gallery


At the bottom of Course settings tile you have a ready-made gallery that will appear in the programme details on your Zooza website. For information on how Zooza Sites work and how to set them up click [here](../setup/zooza-sites.md).
