# New programme with existing clients

When you finish old programmes/classes, you have many clients who want to
 continue with you. That’s why you start thinking about how to create
new programmes and how to transfer your client database.

The app allows multiple ways you can do this for them or with minimal help from them.

## Create a new class

It is not always necessary to create new programmes. This procedure
counts on the fact that the programme with its setting remains and you just
 want to create a new class of people for a new duration of the programme.

You can create a new class within the programme and give it new properties or copy an existing class.
Advantages of copying the class:

- copy all class settings
- possibility of copying terms
- possibility of copying bookings

For a step-by-step guide on transferring and copying individual bookings, see [Transfer and copy bookings](transfer-and-copy-bookings.md).

## Copying all class settings

When copying data, you always have the option of editing it. Whether it’s settings, terms or bookings.
If
 you will be copying bookings along with the class, be aware that
this is a copy not a transfer. This means that no credits, make-up
sessions or payments will be transferred to bookings. Bookings
will have a new booking number (variable symbol) created with
completely clean credit and payment details.

But at the same time, you don’t have to worry that the data will be lost or that the client will no longer have access to it.
The
 client can access the make-up sessions as well as the payment data
via his/her profile, where he/she can see all the data from the original
 bookings and can subsequently work with them further (e.g. replace
 sessions).

When copying bookings, it is important to remember that you are
not copying the client, but only the client’s booking with the
client’s basic data. The system looks at clients through their
bookings. This means that one client can have several bookings
 for different programmes. Therefore, a new booking number is created
for the client.

This copying procedure allows you and your clients to have order in your payments, terms and make-up sessions.

If you need to move a client to a class and want to keep the payment or credit details, use the **Transfer** function on the booking detail. Transfers are done individually per booking, not in bulk. See [Transfer and copy bookings](transfer-and-copy-bookings.md) for the full workflow.

Of course, you always have the option of leaving the booking up
to your clients, who will be notified that you have launched a new
programme and can register for it through your site.

## Creating new terms

If you choose this approach, you will have less work to do in the administration of the application.

Pros:

- you don’t need to create a new class
- no need to copy/move bookings

Cons:

- less clarity in administration – long list with deadlines
- less visibility in payments of both you and the client – debts from the previous period are also displayed

In this procedure, you only create new terms within the original
class. This will ensure that the original bookings are still valid
and will just have new dates added to the programme list. The terms of
payment as well as the make-up sessions remain as they were before.

But what you and your clients may be missing is clarity in terms or
payments. Clients as well as you will have a long list of appointments
and a poorer track record of payments that will be cumulative within a
single booking.

Also, don’t forget that if you have clients who will not continue the
 programme for the term you need to manually discard their bookings by
 changing their booking status. This will ensure that the system
does not send them notification emails and that space is freed up for
other applicants.
