# Client Profile 101

## A simple guide to get you started

The Client Profile helps you manage your bookings, sessions, and payments in one place.

 It works on both mobile phones and computers and does not require remembering any passwords.

## 1. Logging in

If you are not logged in yet, open the Client Profile and enter the email address you used during booking.

This is the same email you use to receive booking and payment information.

##

## 2. No passwords needed

After entering your email address, you will receive either:

- a one-time login code, or
- a secure login link

This will automatically log you in to your Client Profile.

 There is no password to remember.

##

## 3. Your Client Profile

Once logged in, you will see your Client Profile.

Here you can find:

- all your children
- all active and past bookings
- your booking history

Everything related to your bookings is available in one place and can be used fully on mobile.

##

## 4. Programme overview

Open any programme to see its dashboard.

The dashboard shows:

- upcoming sessions
- important programme details
- quick access to key actions

##

## 5. All sessions

In the sessions tab, you can view:

- all scheduled sessions
- attended sessions
- cancelled or missed sessions

The list is always kept up to date.

##

## 6. Sharing a booking

In the booking details, you can share access with another person, for example:

- another parent
- a grandparent
- an older child

This allows them to receive notifications and updates related to the booking.

##

## 7. Payments and invoices

In the payments section, you can:

- see the payment status
- pay online if needed
- download invoices or receipts

Everything related to payments is available anytime.

##

## 8. Missed sessions and make-up sessions

If you cancel a session, you may have the option to:

- choose a make-up session from available options
- confirm it directly in your profile

You will receive email or WhatsApp reminders, and your session list will automatically update.

##

## That's it

The Client Profile is designed to be simple and easy to use.

 You can access it anytime — on your phone or on your computer.

Enjoy
