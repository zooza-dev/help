# Outstanding amount

When each booking is created, the amount owed will be created at the same time. This amount is used to track whether the booking is paid or not.

If the programme-class is free of charge, the booking debt is zero. It is important to note that this amount owed does not change automatically thereafter. So, for example, by adjusting the price of a class or programme, you will not change the amount owed on bookings that have already been created. This is mainly because if the amount of the exchange rate were to change over time in this way, even historically old bookings would suddenly become outstanding because the amount of payments made would not match the amount owed.

It follows that the amount owed does not always have to match the price of the programme-class.

## What is not outstanding amount?


The amount owed has nothing to do with reimbursements. It is not an arrearage, nor is it a "debt" in the form of a reminder, interest on arrears and so on. This is the amount you expect the client to pay you for the booking.
