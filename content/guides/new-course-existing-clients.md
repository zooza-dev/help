# New course with existing clients

When you finish old courses/groups, you have many clients who want to
 continue with you. That’s why you start thinking about how to create
new courses and how to transfer your client database.

The app allows multiple ways you can do this for them or with minimal help from them.

## Create a new group

It is not always necessary to create new courses. This procedure
counts on the fact that the course with its setting remains and you just
 want to create a new group of people for a new duration of the course.

You can create a new group within the course and give it new properties or copy an existing group.
Advantages of copying the group:

- copy all group settings
- possibility of copying terms
- possibility of copying registrations

You can find the procedure how to copy groups, terms and registrations [HERE](https://support.zooza.online/portal/en/kb/articles/copy-courses-groups).

## Copying all group settings

When copying data, you always have the option of editing it. Whether it’s settings, terms or registrations.
If
 you will be copying registrations along with the group, be aware that
this is a copy not a transfer. This means that no credits, replacement
lessons or payments will be transferred to registrations. Registrations
will have a new registration number (variable symbol) created with
completely clean credit and payment details.

But at the same time, you don’t have to worry that the data will be lost or that the client will no longer have access to it.
The
 client can access the replacement lessons as well as the payment data
via his/her profile, where he/she can see all the data from the original
 registrations and can subsequently work with them further (e.g. replace
 lessons).

When copying registrations, it is important to remember that you are
not copying the client, but only the client’s registration with the
client’s basic data. The system looks at clients through their
registrations. This means that one client can have several registrations
 for different courses. Therefore, a new registration number is created
for the client.

This copying procedure allows you and your clients to have order in your payments, terms and replacement lessons.

If you need to move a client to a group and want to keep the payment or credit details, you need to use the *Move Client*
 functionality, which can be found in the registration details. However,
 this transfer can only be done individually after registrations, not in
 bulk.

Of course, you always have the option of leaving the registration up
to your clients, who will be notified that you have launched a new
course and can register for it through your site.

## Creating new terms

If you choose this approach, you will have less work to do in the administration of the application.

Pros:

- you don’t need to create a new group
- no need to copy/move registrations

Cons:

- less clarity in administration – long list with deadlines
- less visibility in payments of both you and the client – debts from the previous period are also displayed

In this procedure, you only create new terms within the original
group. This will ensure that the original registrations are still valid
and will just have new dates added to the course list. The terms of
payment as well as the replacement lessons remain as they were before.

But what you and your clients may be missing is clarity in terms or
payments. Clients as well as you will have a long list of appointments
and a poorer track record of payments that will be cumulative within a
single registration.

Also, don’t forget that if you have clients who will not continue the
 course for the term you need to manually discard their registrations by
 changing their registration status. This will ensure that the system
does not send them notification emails and that space is freed up for
other applicants.
